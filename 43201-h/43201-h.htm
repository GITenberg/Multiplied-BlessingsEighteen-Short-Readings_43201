3</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> short readings, now published
for the first time, are extracts from the written sermons of the
late Rev. E. Hoare, Vicar of Holy Trinity, Tunbridge Wells from
1853 to 1894, and Hon. Canon of Canterbury.&nbsp; They are taken,
word for word, from his original MSS., and have been selected
with a view to giving practical help in the Christian life.&nbsp;
Many of them were written long ago, but the hindrances and
difficulties that meet the Christian continue much the same, and
it is hoped that the following pages may be used of God to bring
before the reader the Lord Jesus Christ as the Saviour, Guide,
and Helper.</p>

5</span>MULTIPLIED BLESSINGS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou art my hiding-place; Thou shalt
preserve me from trouble; Thou shalt compass me about with songs
of deliverance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which
thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.&rdquo;&mdash;Ps.
xxxii. 7, 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, indeed, may the Psalmist say,
&ldquo;Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,&rdquo; for
every blessing flows into the soul as the consequence of divine
forgiveness.&nbsp; The word in the Hebrew rendered
&ldquo;Blessed&rdquo; is in the plural number, to show that there
is not one blessing only, but multiplied blessings and multiplied
mercies, all springing from this one source, the forgiveness of
sin.&nbsp; When David wrote these words he felt the truth of
them.&nbsp; He spoke of a gift which he had himself
experienced.&nbsp; He had found mercy, so he proclaimed its
richness.&nbsp; We know how grievously he fell in the matter of
Bathsheba and Uriah, and we remember Nathan&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp;
It was after that visit that, according to the general belief,
this Psalm was written.&nbsp; He had struggled with the agonies
of unforgiven sin, till at length the message was delivered to
him by the prophet, &ldquo;The Lord, also, hath put away thy
sin.&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; No wonder, then, that he poured
out his heart in this hymn of thanksgiving, commencing with the
words, &ldquo;Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
whose sin is covered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But it is
not merely a Psalm of thanksgiving, for according to the title it
was a Maschil, a Psalm giving instruction.&nbsp; When David was
pleading for mercy in Psalm li., he said that when he had found
forgiveness himself, he would make it known for the good of
others, &ldquo;Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways.&rdquo;
<a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; So now, having been forgiven, he
wrote this Psalm of instruction for others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose
sin is covered.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were the words with which
David commenced his Psalm, and in these words he said that to
which every forgiven soul will most heartily add,
&ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was the peculiar character of that blessedness?&nbsp; We
learn from verses 3 and 4 the awful misery of sin unrepented and
unforgiven.&nbsp; We find how David&rsquo;s tears were dried up
by the burning heat of a guilty conscience, and how the dreadful
burden weighed day and night upon his soul.&nbsp; Then in the
next verse we are taught the secret of the great transition from
misery to peace.&nbsp; We find how he made up his mind to make no
further efforts to conceal his guilt.&nbsp; He resolved to
confess it before God, and no longer attempt to hide it from
man.&nbsp; The result was a complete, assured, and most merciful
forgiveness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou forgavest,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the iniquity of my sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was assured of the
gift, but what was the unspeakable blessedness to which, when
forgiven, he was admitted?</p>
<p>This we learn from the words of our text in which we find the
peaceful intercourse of the forgiven soul with God.&nbsp; It is
that peaceful intercourse which constitutes the real test of
forgiveness, Christ died, the just for the unjust, to bring us to
God: so those <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>who are made partakers of that atoning work are actually
brought to God and made what the Psalmist calls &ldquo;a people
near unto Him.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; So it was in the
case of David.&nbsp; There was nothing to keep him any longer at
a distance, and in the full peace of complete reconciliation he
enjoyed the unspeakable privilege of communion with God.&nbsp;
The account of this communion is given us in the verses of our
text, in the first of which we have the language of the forgiven
sinner to God, in the second the reply from God Himself.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Language of the Forgiven
Soul addressing God</span>.</h3>
<p>He that was afar off without any shelter from the rough storm
of an accusing conscience, is now able to look up to the God who
has forgiven him and say, &ldquo;Thou art my
hiding-place.&rdquo;&nbsp; He finds his shelter and his safety in
the presence of that very God whose law he had broken.&nbsp; He
does not say, &ldquo;Thou hast provided a hiding-place,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;Thou <i>art</i> my hiding-place.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who
had been exposed without protection to the sore buffetings of his
own conscience, confirmed as it was by the just sentence of
God&rsquo;s holy law, had been so completely restored that he had
found in God Himself a hiding-place.</p>
<p>In that sacred hiding-place he realized two results, safety
and praise.&nbsp; When hidden there he was safe, just as our own
life is safe when hidden with Christ in God, and therefore he
could say, &ldquo;Thou shalt preserve me,&rdquo; and when hidden
there he would live in the very atmosphere of thanksgiving, so he
said, &ldquo;Thou shalt compass me about (or surround me) with
songs of deliverance.&rdquo;&nbsp; A song of deliverance is a
song of praise from one that has been delivered.&nbsp; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The Song of
Moses was a song of deliverance when he stood on the shores of
the Red Sea after he had seen the hosts of Egypt overwhelmed in
the flood. <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; David&rsquo;s was a song of
deliverance when God had brought him up out of the horrible pit
and established his goings, and had put a new song in his mouth.
<a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; The song of the great multitude
before the throne is a song of deliverance, when, brought out of
great tribulation, clothed with white robes and palms in their
hands, they sing, &ldquo;Salvation to our God which sitteth upon
the throne, and unto the Lamb.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a></p>
<p>Observe the connection between this safety and these songs of
deliverance.&nbsp; The songs are not merely the consequence of
the safety, but a part of it.&nbsp; Hidden in the Lord, we are
compassed, or surrounded, by them.&nbsp; Whichever way we look,
whether forward in hope, or backward in memory, or upwards in
trust, there is in every direction something to call forth the
praise, and the spirit of thanksgiving is in itself a protection
against assault.</p>
<p>There is just the same connection between praise and safety in
the description of the restored Zion: &ldquo;Thou shalt call thy
walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.&rdquo; <a
name="citation8d"></a><a href="#footnote8d"
class="citation">[8d]</a>&nbsp; Praise is there represented as
part of the defence.&nbsp; The enemy cannot enter because the
gateway is filled by praise.&nbsp; The song of deliverance is so
hearty and so loud that the voice of the tempter is not
heard.&nbsp; And thus it is that the forgiven man, hidden in
Christ Jesus, praises God, because he has been saved, and
confirms his safety by the very act of praising Him.&nbsp; Does
not this teach us a lesson as to our own communion with
God?&nbsp; Whatever it is that weighs on the heart and disturbs
the spirit, whatever <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>the storm be that beats upon us, whether it be care from
without or conscience within, whether it be the pain of trouble
or the still greater pain of the sense of sin, the forgiven man
may go straight to Him and say, &ldquo;I flee unto Thee to hide
me.&rdquo; <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a>&nbsp; And if hidden in Him, can
anything really hurt us?&nbsp; Is not His salvation a sufficient
wall?&nbsp; Shall anything that can really hurt us enter in by
those gates which He has closed with praise?&nbsp; In holy peace,
then let the songs of deliverance rise before Him.&nbsp; Let the
unspeakable blessedness of the divine safety call forth the notes
of thanksgiving.&nbsp; If the sweet note of praise was heard by
the prisoners from the inner dungeon at Philippi, <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> shall it not be heard by the whole
church of God from those who have found a hiding-place in their
Lord?</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Lord&rsquo;s Reply to the
Forgiven Man</span>.</h3>
<p>Such, then, was the language of the forgiven man to the God
who had forgiven him.&nbsp; What reply did he receive?&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
shalt go: I will guide thee with Mine eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; You will
observe that what is here promised is His own divine guidance and
instruction, and you will see at once how appropriate such a
promise was under the peculiar circumstances of the case.&nbsp;
David had grievously fallen.&nbsp; He had been walking, in former
times, in God&rsquo;s way, but had turned aside in a most awful
manner.&nbsp; We do not know what was the preparatory process in
his mind.&nbsp; Perhaps he had forgotten his weakness; perhaps he
had grown self-confident and fell.&nbsp; But we see what God
promised now that he was restored.&nbsp; He undertook in future
to keep him Himself, by His own instruction and His own
guidance.&nbsp; The Lord Himself undertook to guide him, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and so keep
him safe from the danger of another fall.</p>
<p>There are two points in this promise.&nbsp; It was <i>in</i>
the way, not <i>about</i> the way, that God promised to guide
him.&nbsp; When he was walking in the narrow way God under took
to walk with him there, and to hold him fast in His own right
hand till the journey should be complete, and the rest reached at
the end.&nbsp; Let us all learn the lesson that God&rsquo;s
teaching is only found in the path of God&rsquo;s
commandments.&nbsp; If we choose to walk in some way of our own
choosing, we must not expect the guidance of the Lord.</p>
<p>Observe also what I may term the delicacy of the promise and
the intimacy of the relationship.&nbsp; God says, &ldquo;I will
guide thee with Mine eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When David was living in a state of impenitence, the strong
hand of God was upon him day and night.&nbsp; But now a look is
enough.&nbsp; No force is needed.&nbsp; The heart is tender, the
ear is open, the eye is fixed on the Lord Jesus, and the least
intimation of His will is sufficient.&nbsp; The passage seems to
describe the eye of the Lord watching over His children, and the
eyes of His children fixed on the Lord.&nbsp; When the Lord Jesus
looked on Peter, Peter must have been looking on Him, and one
look melted his heart.&nbsp; And so when the Lord is guiding us,
there is no need of strong or violent discipline, of the wind,
the storm, or the earthquake, for the still small voice is
enough.&nbsp; What is needed is that we should be living looking
unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, seeking to know
His will, drinking in His word, watching the guidance of His
providence, applying the principles of Scripture to common life,
and so not waiting till conviction is forced upon us, but, with a
tender heart and a ready mind, seeking hour by hour <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to do His
will.&nbsp; It is in such an attitude of mind that we can realize
the sacred promise, &ldquo;I will guide thee with Mine
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such, then, was the intercourse of this forgiven man with
God.&nbsp; How close, how intimate, how sacred, how blessed, the
communion!&nbsp; And how complete must have been the forgiveness
that prepared the way for it.&nbsp; It seems almost impossible to
believe that this was the same man on whom God&rsquo;s hand had
been heavy day and night, the same whose bones had waxed old
through his roaring all the day long, now forgiven, now brought
into happy intercourse with God.&nbsp; Does not the passage teach
a wonderful lesson to every soul that has been mercifully
forgiven in Christ Jesus?&nbsp; When we think of the precious
blood of Christ, and how the Lord laid on Him the iniquity of us
all, can we suppose for a moment that the forgiveness bestowed on
us is less complete, or the restoration less perfect, than that
of David?&nbsp; Since, then, in his case, the insuperable barrier
of his guilt was so completely broken down that he was admitted
to this sacred and intimate fellowship, why should any one of us
remain at a distance?&nbsp; Why should not we, even we, go before
the same Father to find in Him our hiding-place, and receive from
Him the same blessed assurance, &ldquo;I will guide thee with
Mine eye&rdquo;?&nbsp; May He accompany us through life with that
loving guidance and watch over every step we take till, by His
great grace, we are safe from danger.</p>
<h2><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>THE
SAVIOUR SEEKING THE SINNER</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What man of you, having an hundred sheep,
if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the
wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find
it?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> xv. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many amongst us truly and
conscientiously seeking the Lord whose souls are ill at ease, and
whose hearts are far from peace.&nbsp; They are feeling after
Him, if haply they may find Him; but they are like blind men
groping for the wall, for they have not found Him, and they have
no firm resting-place for their faith.&nbsp; They have been
reading many passages about seeking the Lord, and have
endeavoured to seek Him, but they are sorely discouraged.</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, change the subject, and instead of
considering how they are to seek the Lord, let us see how the
Lord seeks them.&nbsp; Let us look at the Divine side of the
transaction, and instead of being absorbed by the subject of the
sinner seeking the Saviour, let us look at the boundless grace of
God which is shown by the Saviour seeking the sinner.</p>
<p>It is the great subject of this chapter, which contains three
illustrations of the one subject, and thus forms an illustrated
comment on His words, &ldquo;The Son of man is come to seek and
to save that which <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>was lost.&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; According to
those words He came for the lost, and came not only to save them
when they should succeed in finding Him, but to seek them in
order that He may save.&nbsp; He does not save without seeking,
nor does He seek without saving.&nbsp; Let us glean some lessons,
from the combination of the three illustrations, as to the loss
of the sinner, and the seeking of the Saviour.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Loss</span>.</h3>
<p>In all three cases the recovered one is said to have been
lost.&nbsp; The sheep was lost.&nbsp; The coin was lost.&nbsp;
The son was lost.</p>
<p>If we study the illustrations in detail we shall see that
there are three ways described in the chapter in which this loss
is brought about.</p>
<p>It is brought about, in the case of the lost sheep, through
simple ignorance and the folly of pursuing each passing object of
attraction.&nbsp; The wandering sheep has no particular intention
of going wrong.&nbsp; It does not set off with a deliberate wish
to run away; it is simply led on step by step by any attraction
that lies beside its path.&nbsp; And is not this the case with
thousands of those who have wandered from the Shepherd&rsquo;s
care?</p>
<p>In the second parable the loss is occasioned by the neglect of
others.&nbsp; The piece of money is lost through carelessness,
without any fault of its own.&nbsp; The person who had the charge
of it took no heed to be sure that it was safe.&nbsp; How many
are there in exactly that position?&nbsp; They have been lost,
humanly speaking, through want of care.</p>
<p>But the third character is quite distinct from both the
others.&nbsp; The Prodigal Son was lost because he deliberately
and determinately left his father&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>He was
totally unlike the wandering sheep led on from step to step
without a plan, for he had a plan, and he deliberately carried it
out.&nbsp; This, then, is far the worst of the three.&nbsp; It
represents one living in the midst of privileges, but
deliberately casting away his faith.&nbsp; He has life and death
brought before him, and he chooses death, or, at all events, he
chooses that which leads to death.&nbsp; Oh! how marvellous is
the boundless grace and mercy of our God, that He should go out
of His way to seek and to save any one so unthankful and so
guilty!</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Seeking of the Saviour</span>.</h3>
<p>He seeks by coming Himself as the Son of Man.&nbsp; The
Shepherd leaving the fold and going forth into the wilderness to
seek the wanderer, is a picture of the Son of God leaving the
glory which He had with the Father before the world was, and
visiting this fallen world as the Son of man, in order that He
might seek, and, by His atoning blood, might save the
sinner.&nbsp; We shall never understand His grace in seeking us
if we do not realize that great act of His already
complete.&nbsp; This great finished work of His is the foundation
of all that follows, and if we want to understand the mystery of
His love in seeking us we must begin with the two great facts,
Incarnation and Atonement.&nbsp; Why did He become man?&nbsp; Why
was He born at Bethlehem?&nbsp; Was it not because He came on a
divine mission to seek the sinner?&nbsp; Why did He die?&nbsp;
Why did He utter that bitter cry upon the cross?&nbsp; Was it not
that He might remove the curse by bearing it, and having broken
down every barrier, might have the joy of bringing the lost one
to the Father&rsquo;s home?&nbsp; You, then, who are anxious
about your souls, and whose earnest desire it is to be sought out
and saved, remember what the Son of man <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>has already
done; fall back on the finished fact; and never forget that
however doubtful you may be as to your own position, there is no
doubt whatever as to the fact that the Son of God has come to
seek the lost one and to save him by His blood.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">He seeks through Human
Agency</span>.</h3>
<p>I cannot think that the woman lighting a candle and sweeping
the house represents the Saviour.&nbsp; She is generally, and I
think correctly, thought to represent the Church.&nbsp; If this
be the case it may serve to teach how the whole Church of Christ
ought to be entirely engaged in carrying out the sacred mission
of our Blessed Lord.&nbsp; It is not the Spirit alone that is to
say &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a> but the Bride and
all that hear the message.&nbsp; He has become man and died for
us, but we are to light the candle, sweep the house, and seek
diligently till we find the lost ones.&nbsp; We are to spare no
effort for their recovery: we are to search them out; we are to
let them know that there is a Christian friend anxious for their
safety, and that there will not only be joy amongst the angels of
God, but a hearty welcome amongst His people on earth for any
poor lost one brought in lowly repentance to the feet of the
Blessed Saviour, there to find pardon and recovery.</p>
<p>And what are we to say of the third parable, for we find no
mention of the seeking there.&nbsp; But we find the divine act
most remarkably represented, for there we may see how God Himself
seeks the wanderer.&nbsp; We do not see the father doing it in
the parable, but we do see how God Himself does it in fact.&nbsp;
We there see the work both of His providence and of His
Spirit.&nbsp; Of His providence, for the Father in heaven both
sought and found him, just as He is doing with thousands
now.&nbsp; He took from him one thing after <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>another till
all hope was gone, and he envied even the swine their meal.&nbsp;
God was seeking him, so He broke him down and crushed him on
purpose that He might save.</p>
<p>But God did much more than bring him into trouble, for trouble
very often does nothing but harden.&nbsp; But in this case the
Spirit of God was seeking him, so that it was a trouble blessed
by the Spirit, and he was led with a broken heart to say,
&ldquo;Father, I have sinned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See how God Himself sought him and brought him to true
repentance.&nbsp; He was far away from the hand of man.&nbsp; He
was lost to his father&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; But he was never lost
sight of by God.&nbsp; There was a loving eye watching him, and a
loving care seeking him, so that though lost to man he was not
lost to God, and his father with a full heart was able at length
to say, &ldquo;This my son was dead and is alive again; he was
lost and is found.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>A
DIVINE SALVATION</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Salvation is of
the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jonah</span> ii.
9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According as His divine power hath given unto us all
things that pertain onto life and godliness, through the
knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and
virtue.&rdquo;&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">St. Peter</span> i.
3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one can read his Bible without
being convinced that it is full of practical exhortations as to
human conduct and human effort.&nbsp; Those who are seeking the
Lord Jesus Christ are exhorted to repent, to believe, to be
converted, to seek, to come, and to follow on to know the
Lord.&nbsp; Hence it follows that as we are very apt to see only
one side of anything at a time, there is a great tendency to
dwell exclusively on human action, and to exhort, and to
persuade, as if everything was in our own hands, so that we may
do just what we please, and when we please, in the great matter
of our soul&rsquo;s salvation.&nbsp; People are apt to write and
speak about coming to Jesus as if it all rested with the sinner
himself.&nbsp; But this, though deduced from a truth, is not the
whole truth of Scripture.&nbsp; We find there beyond all doubt
the warning, the offer and the invitation; but we find also the
clear description of a divine salvation, the plan of divine
wisdom, and the gift of divine grace.&nbsp; Accordingly in this
passage when St. Peter <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> is addressing <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>those who had
obtained like precious faith with himself, he makes it perfectly
clear at the very outset of his letter that they had obtained it,
not by the power of their own energy, or the determination of
their own will, but through the power of God, the gift of God,
and the call of God, &ldquo;whereby were given unto them
exceeding great and precious promises.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a></p>
<p>Let us, therefore, turn our attention to the divine side of
the great transaction, and trace through four successive steps,
the divine Saviour, the divine salvation, the divine revelation,
and the divine application.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">A Divine Saviour</span>.</h3>
<p>It is not my business now to make any attempt to prove the
divinity of our Blessed Redeemer, for I take it for granted that
we all admit the great truths of Christianity.&nbsp; What I
desire now to do is to point out that, if saved at all, we are
saved by a Person, and that that Person is divine.&nbsp; The Lord
Jesus Christ is a personal Saviour, and as a personal Saviour,
saves us from the death of sin.&nbsp; It is as much a personal
act as when a bold swimmer leaps into the ocean and saves a
drowning man.</p>
<p>Now it is plain that everything depends on the nature and
power of the person who saves us.&nbsp; If He be only man, then
we can hope for nothing more than a man-made salvation.&nbsp; The
salvation will not rise above the Saviour; but if He is divine,
then we may rest on His divine omnipotence, and look for the
power of God unto salvation.&nbsp; Thus the divinity of the Lord
Jesus Christ is a matter of life and death to us.&nbsp; The
question is whether we are to save ourselves or be saved by our
God.&nbsp; And this is the issue which He Himself raised when He
said, &ldquo;I give unto them eternal life.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a>&nbsp; The statement of that passage <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>is that He,
as a Person, holds His people in His own hand, and holds them
with omnipotent strength because He is divine, for He and the
Father are one.&nbsp; There, then, is both the foundation and the
keystone of our trust.&nbsp; We may see all kinds of
difficulties; there may be confusion, perplexity, and the cry of
distress in every direction, but according to His divine power
God has provided a divine Saviour, and in that Saviour we may
rest, for He is the Son of God.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">A Divine Salvation</span>.</h3>
<p>The whole plan from first to last is divine.&nbsp; The world
is full of human plans, some of which are successful and some
total failures.&nbsp; One man contrives one thing and one
another, but God alone planned the great salvation.&nbsp; It was
not in the power of ruined nature to restore itself, so in
boundless mercy and in His own divine omnipotence He provided a
plan of restoration.&nbsp; Thus the purpose is divine, His own
eternal purpose before the world was; the mode of reconciliation
is divine, the release of the sinner through the imputation of
sin to the sin-bearer.&nbsp; The propitiation was divine,
&ldquo;Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith
in His blood.&rdquo; <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a>&nbsp; The
imputation of righteousness is divine, &ldquo;For God hath made
Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; <a name="citation20b"></a><a
href="#footnote20b" class="citation">[20b]</a></p>
<p>The work of sanctification is divine, &ldquo;Of Him are ye in
Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us . . .
sanctification;&rdquo; <a name="citation20c"></a><a
href="#footnote20c" class="citation">[20c]</a> and the final
gathering of God&rsquo;s elect will be divine for &ldquo;all that
are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come
forth.&rdquo; <a name="citation20d"></a><a href="#footnote20d"
class="citation">[20d]</a></p>
<p>It is most important to bear this well in mind, for it <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>places the
subject beyond the sphere of human speculation.&nbsp; If a man
starts a new system of philosophy, or if people advocate any
particular system in politics, we are perfectly at liberty to
criticise it.&nbsp; What one man does, another man may
criticise.&nbsp; But it is a very different thing with the
salvation of God.&nbsp; Once admit that it is a divine plan,
arranged in divine wisdom and carried out in divine power, and it
is then manifestly beyond the reach of human intellect.&nbsp;
There may be things in it which seem to us very mysterious; but
what else can we expect when the infinite and divine arrangements
of God are subjected to the speculations of the finite mind of
man?&nbsp; If the whole salvation were of such a character as to
present no points of difficulty to the human inquirer, we might
almost doubt its divinity, and believe that as it is within the
range of man&rsquo;s mind, so it had its origin in man&rsquo;s
ingenuity.&nbsp; But when we see it beyond the reach of man, then
we are taught by our own inability to fathom it, to regard it as
a plan above ourselves, for the simple reason that it is
divine.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Divine Revelation</span>.</h3>
<p>But when we have acknowledged that the Saviour and the
salvation are divine, there remains a further question of the
utmost possible importance.&nbsp; It is this.&nbsp; In what way
is this divine salvation made known to mankind?&nbsp; Is it known
by human discovery or divine communication?&nbsp; Do we know it
by thinking out the subject, or by receiving a revelation from
God?&nbsp; Surely the answer to this question is obvious, that a
divine salvation can only be known by a divine
communication.&nbsp; The eternal purpose of God can only be known
by divine communication from Himself.&nbsp; A supernatural
salvation requires in the very nature of things a supernatural
communication from <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>God.&nbsp; Thus an Apostle describes <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> the faith, not as having been
<i>discovered by</i> the saints, but as having been <i>delivered
to</i> the saints, delivered to them, that is, in God&rsquo;s own
inspired Word.&nbsp; As God has planned a complete salvation, so
He has given a complete revelation of that salvation.&nbsp; He
has not left us to grope for it as blind men feeling for the
wall; but has revealed His plan in His own word, and taught us to
rest in the scripture of truth as His own revelation of His
purpose of grace.</p>
<h3>IV.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Divine
Application</span>.</h3>
<p>To many this is the most difficult of the four points
mentioned at the outset.&nbsp; They are perfectly satisfied as to
the divine Saviour, the divine salvation, and the divine
revelation in the Word of God, but have found no little
difficulty in the application of it to themselves.&nbsp; They can
see the chain with its three links hanging down from heaven over
their heads, but it is just out of their own reach, and as a poor
dying sailor once said to me, &ldquo;I see the rope, but I cannot
get hold of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they see the salvation, but
cannot get hold of it as their own.&nbsp; If there are any
anxious on the subject, and earnestly desiring &ldquo;to get
hold&rdquo; on the great salvation, let them remember that what
they really want is for <i>the Saviour to lay hold on them</i>,
and this is what He practically does by the power of the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; It is the peculiar office of the Holy Ghost to take
of the things of the Lord Jesus Christ and apply them unto us,
and without that act of His we may struggle in vain to reach the
blessing.&nbsp; It is not enough for us to be told that God has
provided a perfect Saviour, that that Saviour has made a perfect
propitiation, and that by virtue of that propitiation the great
salvation is offered to us as a gift.&nbsp; We may be <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>assured of
all that and yet live on without it, for we want in addition that
which the human heart cannot find in itself, the power to receive
the gift and, receiving it, to live.&nbsp; It is by this mighty
power that those who sleep are awakened; those far off are
brought nigh; the bondsmen are set free; the dead made alive, and
those who are strangers and outcasts are made heirs of God
through the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>There is no case too hopeless for the Lord&rsquo;s
salvation.&nbsp; There are many who have been so utterly
unsuccessful in their efforts to rise that they begin to think
there is something peculiar in themselves which makes them an
exception to the general offer of life and pardon.&nbsp; And
there are others who are longing for the salvation of some
stubborn, unbroken heart, but who have sought so long and so
hopelessly that they almost begin to despair.&nbsp; Now whether
your anxiety be for yourself or others, remember the divinity of
the great salvation.&nbsp; If the whole is divine, why should it
not be sufficient?&nbsp; You say you are dead, but cannot the
divine power raise the dead?&nbsp; You say your sins are too
great for pardon, but is not the divine propitiation sufficient
for them all?&nbsp; You say you cannot produce even a good
prayer, but does not the divine revelation assure you that the
salvation is a free gift even for those who have nothing?</p>
<p>Give up, then, all thought of working yourself up to
salvation, for that is a mere human process, and is certain to
fail, but throw yourself <i>before you are saved</i> right away
on the Saviour for His great gift of salvation.&nbsp; Remember
that the whole thing from first to last is divine, and, because
it is divine, as a little child trust it without the slightest
qualification, trust the promise, accept the gift, and may God
grant that you <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>may be able to use as your own the words of the text,
&ldquo;According as His divine power hath given unto me all
things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the
knowledge of Him who hath called <i>me</i> to glory and
virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>FEELINGS</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Love, joy,
peace.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gal</span>. v. 22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Feelings</span> clearly have their place
in the things of God.&nbsp; Our Christianity is based on
principles, but still it calls forth the feelings.&nbsp; Now
there are two great extremes into which we are apt to fall with
reference to Christian feeling.</p>
<p>There are some whose religion seems to consist in feeling
only.&nbsp; They look for warm, bright emotions, they bring
everything to the standard of their feelings, and if they feel as
they wish to do they are satisfied.&nbsp; Their hearts are warmed
by the things of God, and many a cold, phlegmatic theologian
would be a different being if he could but catch something of
their feeling.</p>
<p>But still we must put in a caution, for feelings, however
bright, are not to be trusted unless they rise out of principle
and end in practice.&nbsp; If you have feeling only&mdash;a
feeling not based on solid acquaintance with Scriptural truth, it
will rise like a bubble, and look as beautiful in its colours,
but it will burst as easily as the bubble does, and even at its
best estate can never bear the slightest pressure.&nbsp; Here,
then, is one extreme&mdash;the religion of feeling, of emotion,
of impression, taking the place of the religion of conviction, of
principle, of faith.</p>
<p>But there is another extreme: I mean the religion <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>without
feeling.&nbsp; Some seem to think all emotion, or warmth, or
fervour is enthusiasm, and settle down satisfied with a cold
reception of Christian truth.&nbsp; They may be quite correct in
their creed, and may really believe all the great truths of the
Gospel, but their system is to give no expression to Christian
emotion, and this has a wonderful power of chilling all around
them.</p>
<p>We must not rest satisfied with an unfeeling consent to
Christian truth.&nbsp; We want to feel as well as to know, and to
have the heart really warmed by the tender love of our gracious
Saviour.&nbsp; But here I suspect that I shall be met by a great
difficulty on the part of many of you, for this feeling is
exactly that which many cannot find.&nbsp; You can understand,
but you cannot feel.&nbsp; Your great trouble is, that there is
such a dreadful apathy over your whole soul that nothing seems to
rouse it.&nbsp; If this is the case consider&mdash;</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Feelings, however Warm, can
never justify, and the Want of Feeling does not prevent
Justification</span>.</h3>
<p>I have known persons who have long since given up all idea of
being justified by <i>works</i>, who still have a secret clinging
to some idea of being justified by <i>feelings</i>.&nbsp; If they
could but feel more&mdash;more love, more repentance, more
warmth&mdash;then they think they could trust Christ for their
acceptance.&nbsp; They have learned, they think, to trust Him if
they have the feelings, but they would not venture to do so
without them.</p>
<p>Now, before they can be happy in Christ they will have to go a
step deeper, and learn to trust Him when they have not the
feelings as well as when they have.&nbsp; They must remember that
our justification is entirely dependent on His atonement and His
righteousness, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>and so it is His free gift, freely given to those that
are dead in sin.&nbsp; Now a dead man has no feelings.&nbsp; If,
therefore, we wait for our justification until we have the
feelings we must wait till we are alive.&nbsp; But the language
of Scripture is, &ldquo;God, who is rich in mercy, for His great
love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath
quickened us together with Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; Your only hope, therefore, is to
trust Him as you are, without waiting till you are one atom
warmer than you are at this present moment.&nbsp; With your heart
as cold as you now feel it to be, you must throw yourself at once
before His feet, and cry, &ldquo;Lord, save me, I
perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closely connected with this suggestion is another, namely
this&mdash;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">If you want to be made to feel,
you must lose no Time in going Near to a Father&rsquo;s
Throne</span>.</h3>
<p>You will never feel warm while you stand shivering outside the
city.&nbsp; You must go inside, even while you are cold, and
there have your heart warmed by the Lord Himself.&nbsp; Remember
that the great heart-warming subject is the tender love of God as
displayed in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; If the love of Christ does not
make you feel, nothing else will.&nbsp; Do not, therefore, stand
afar off gazing on your own coldness, but turn at once to the
Cross of Christ.&nbsp; Study Him in the garden bowed down under
the heavy burden of sin; study Him on the cross forsaken even of
the Father, and remember that all that was borne for you, even
for you.&nbsp; Remember there was a personal connection between
Him and you in the whole of that great transaction, and so abide,
as it were, gazing on the Lord Jesus, on His life, on His
meekness, on His burden, on His cry.&nbsp; <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Pray God that
you may realize your part in the whole matter.&nbsp; Confess
before Him your own cold, dead, lifeless condition.&nbsp; Trust
Him, as He died for you, to save you from it; and so you may hope
that, though you feel so cold as you approach Him, you may
experience something of His love when you gaze on Him, and know
something even of His joy when you go on your way justified
through His grace.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Remember well that Feeling is
the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and that you cannot work yourself up
to it</span>.</h3>
<p>It is very clearly the work of the Holy Spirit to call forth
feeling.&nbsp; He does not act on the head only, but on the heart
also.&nbsp; He opens the understanding, but His great office is
to make His people feel what they already know.&nbsp; Thus of the
nine fruits of the Spirit <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a> the first three
are all emotions.&nbsp; Their seat is neither in the head nor in
the practice, but they are all feelings of the heart,
&ldquo;Love, joy, peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; They all lead to practice,
and all are founded on principle, but all three are sacred
emotions implanted there by the Holy Ghost Himself.</p>
<p>If, therefore, your cold, unfeeling heart is a real sorrow to
you; if the trouble of your heart is that your sins trouble you
so little, and that you feel so coldly towards that Blessed
Saviour who has felt for you so deeply, rest not content, but
throw yourself before God that the Spirit of grace and of
supplication may enable you to look upon Him whom you have
pierced, that He may take of the things of Jesus and show them
unto you; that He may call forth in your soul His own fruits of
love, joy, and peace, and that so He may answer you the
Apostle&rsquo;s prayer&mdash;&ldquo;The God of Hope fill you with
all joy and peace in believing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<h2><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>A
PEACEFUL DEATH-BED</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart
in peace, according to Thy word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> ii.
29, 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> thoughts are often directed to
the blessed prospect of our Lord&rsquo;s return, and there cannot
be a doubt that His personal coming is the crowning hope of the
Church of God.&nbsp; At the same time, it is most important for
us to be, if I may so express it, familiar with the thought of
the present heaven.&nbsp; The youngest amongst us may be cut down
at any moment, and the old amongst us must be convinced that our
time is short, and that our places must soon be filled by
others.&nbsp; We ought, therefore, to know where we are going,
and what it is that awaits us when &ldquo;the earthly house of
this tabernacle shall be dissolved.&rdquo; <a
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a></p>
<p>The words of our text, so often chanted in our churches,
express a sentiment to which, I fear, many who chant them are
entire strangers, for they express the peaceful readiness with
which Simeon was looking forward to his death.&nbsp; It had been
&ldquo;revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not
see death, before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; He had, therefore, spent his
latter days waiting and watching <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>for the promised Christ, and at
length, when the Child was presented in the Temple, he saw in
that Child the Messiah for whom he had been waiting, and then it
was that, his hope being fulfilled, he could bless God and say,
&ldquo;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are three subjects suggested by his words.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The View which is here given of
Death</span>.</h3>
<p>He does not speak of it as annihilation, destruction, or
stupefaction, but as a departure or removal from one place to
another.&nbsp; If a person were to depart from this place and go
elsewhere, he would simply change his home.&nbsp; Until he
departs his home is here, but when he departs his home is
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Is it not exactly the same when the spirit departs from its
present home and removes to the building of God, the house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens?&nbsp; In this case, as
in an earthly removal, departure implies the continuance of
life.&nbsp; Thus I rejoice in the many passages in which death is
spoken of as a departure.&nbsp; It was clearly the idea in the
mind of St. Paul, as when he said, &ldquo;having a desire to
depart,&rdquo; <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> and again, &ldquo;The time of my
departure is at hand.&rdquo; <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a>&nbsp; When those
we love are in far distant lands we see them not, but they are
there; our eyes cannot behold them, nor our ears hear their
pleasant voices, for they are far away, but that does not lead us
to doubt either their life, their intelligence, or their
affection.&nbsp; Just so it is with those that are gone.&nbsp; We
no longer hear the voice, or look on the loved countenance, but
we are fully persuaded that, as spirits, they are living
elsewhere, that separation is not destruction, and that removal
does not involve the diminution of the intelligent powers of the
living mind.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>But if
death is thus a departure, where is the place to which the spirit
goes?&nbsp; Over this point there is a veil thrown in
Scripture.&nbsp; If we were to know all about it there would be
nothing in the knowledge to affect our practical conduct, so
there is no knowledge given.&nbsp; Nor do we require it, for one
thing is told us, and that one thing is enough.&nbsp; If assured
of that one thing we want no more.&nbsp; What, then, is that one
thing so clearly revealed to us in God&rsquo;s holy Word?&nbsp;
Where shall we find an account of it?&nbsp; Let us turn to the
language of the Apostle Paul: &ldquo;I am in a strait betwixt
two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; He knew, therefore, that in his
departure he should depart to be with Christ, in the conscious
enjoyment of His perceptible and never-ceasing love.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Spirit in which the
Believer may die</span>.</h3>
<p>This is described in the words of Simeon, &ldquo;Let thy
servant depart in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Simeon could look forward
to his dying hour in a tranquil spirit of calm, resting
peace.&nbsp; How often is there care on the heart of the dying
believer.&nbsp; A father may be leaving his wife and family, who
have been dependent on him for support; or a mother her children,
with the strong conviction that there is no substitute for a
mother&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Let no one suppose that there is no
trial of faith in such a separation, and that it is not, in many
cases, very hard to trust.&nbsp; But in Christ Jesus there may be
peace even in such a parting, and the dying mother, if she knows
her Saviour, may trust her all into His loving hands, and say,
&ldquo;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is
able to keep that which I have committed unto Him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a>&nbsp; She has committed her children
into His care.&nbsp; They are her deposit with God, and she may
be at perfect peace in the <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>assurance that, though <i>she</i> is
departing, <i>He</i> is remaining, and will remain a faithful
Saviour till every one of those dear children is presented safe
before His throne.</p>
<p>Let no one suppose that it is not a very solemn thing to die,
to be suddenly cut off from everything of which we have ever had
any experience, and to launch out alone into an invisible
world.&nbsp; It cannot, therefore, be an easy thing to die in
peace.&nbsp; But, thanks be to God, we believe that the departing
spirit passes at once into the loving presence of our Redeemer,
and why should there not be peace?&nbsp; I believe it is the
forgetfulness of this personal entrance into the personal
presence of a personal Saviour that sometimes seems to darken the
dying hour.&nbsp; People forget those few words, &ldquo;Thou art
with me,&rdquo; <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a> and then they are afraid.&nbsp; But
when we rest on those words, and combine them with our assured
hope, knowing that He is now with us invisibly, and that we are
going to be with Him visibly, then we shall be able to say, as
Simeon did, &ldquo;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Great Foundation of
Simeon&rsquo;s Peaceful Trust</span>.</h3>
<p>His eyes had seen the salvation of God.&nbsp; What he had
really seen was the promised Messiah, that is, the Lord&rsquo;s
Christ.&nbsp; The little child was the promised Saviour, and to
him the Saviour was salvation.&nbsp; The Person and the Gift were
so bound together that they were as one.&nbsp; He could not know
the Person without the Gift, or enjoy the Gift except through the
Person.&nbsp; Thus our Lord, more than thirty years afterwards,
spoke of Himself as &ldquo;the Salvation,&rdquo; <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a> when He said, as He entered into the
house of Zacch&aelig;us, &ldquo;This day is salvation come to
this house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Simeon had what <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>we cannot
have, something material that he could handle and look
upon.&nbsp; His hand could handle and his eye could see the
little child; and there cannot be a doubt that there is in the
human mind a craving after something visible, tangible, and
material.&nbsp; But we have nothing of the kind; we cannot hold
our salvation in our hands.&nbsp; Neither do we want it
there.&nbsp; It is safer in the hands of our Lord Himself.&nbsp;
But though we cannot say, &ldquo;Mine <i>eyes</i> have
seen,&rdquo; we can say, thanks be to God, &ldquo;Mine
<i>heart</i> hath seen,&rdquo; and we can understand the words,
&ldquo;Whom having not seen, ye love.&rdquo; <a
name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a"
class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; There is exactly the same union
in that passage between the Saviour and the salvation.&nbsp;
Receiving Him we receive salvation, and beholding Him with the
eye of faith we behold, as it were, our names written in the Book
of Life.</p>
<p>To behold the Saviour is a very personal matter.&nbsp; It is
not merely to behold Him like a monument on a distant hill, which
we can admire, but never enter; or as a harbour of refuge which
we cannot reach.&nbsp; It must not be with us as it was with
Balaam when he said, &ldquo;I shall behold Him, but not
nigh,&rdquo; <a name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a> for the invitation to us is to draw
near, and our privilege is in our inmost soul to pour out our
heart before Him, as before One who knows all its secrets, and
through His own most precious blood has blotted out all its
guilt.&nbsp; This has thrown a gleam of sacred light into many a
death-chamber.&nbsp; May God grant that it may be the same with
each of us.&nbsp; Let none of us rest until we can say,
&ldquo;Mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,&rdquo; till we not
merely know that there is a Saviour, but can rest assured that He
has saved us, and has made us&mdash;even us&mdash;heirs of God
and joint-heirs with Himself in His kingdom.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>A
PEACEFUL LIFE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To me to live is Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Phil</span>. i. 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have studied the subject of a
peaceful death-bed and I hope we learned how to die.&nbsp; Let us
now turn our thoughts to a peaceful life and endeavour to learn
how to live.&nbsp; The two things are bound fast together.</p>
<p>Let us study what St. Paul meant when he said, &ldquo;To me to
live is Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; When there is any one object, for
which, and in which, a person lives, it is not an uncommon thing
to say it is his life.&nbsp; To a certain extent this explains
the expression, &ldquo;To me to live is Christ,&rdquo; for the
Lord Jesus Christ was the one absorbing object of St.
Paul&rsquo;s whole life.&nbsp; He thought of Him; he leaned on
Him; he trusted in Him; he loved Him, and he lived for Him.&nbsp;
He could not do without Him.&nbsp; If we look at the subject more
in detail we find three things very clearly taught us in
Scripture.&nbsp; Our life is hidden <i>with</i> Him, dependent
<i>on</i> Him, and devoted <i>to</i> Him.</p>
<h3>HIDDEN WITH HIM</h3>
<p>In this stormy world we perpetually need a hiding-place, a
shelter from the storm, and a covert from the blast.&nbsp; And so
in the great prophecy of our Lord and Saviour revealed in Isaiah,
we read of Him, &ldquo;A man <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>shall be as an hiding-place from the
wind.&rdquo; <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; But three centuries before
Isaiah uttered that prophecy David had learnt to hide under His
care, and said of Him, &ldquo;Thou art my hiding-place.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a>&nbsp; The trouble from which he was
hiding was deep conviction of sin.&nbsp; In consequence of his
sin the hand of God had been heavy upon him day and night.&nbsp;
But at length the guilt of his great sin had been blotted out,
and as a forgiven man he could find shelter in the very God
against whom he had transgressed.&nbsp; He could hide himself in
the love of Him against whom he had sinned, and instead of
finding the Lord&rsquo;s hand heavy upon him, he could rejoice in
the thought that there was a wall of praise around him.&nbsp; Now
just in the same way our life is said to be hidden with
Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your life is hid with Christ in God.&rdquo;
<a name="citation34c"></a><a href="#footnote34c"
class="citation">[34c]</a>&nbsp; It is not exposed to the rude
shocks of the outer world, but is hidden with Him.&nbsp; As
<i>He</i> is unseen, so <i>it</i> is unseen; but as <i>He</i> is
safe at the right hand of the Father, so is <i>it</i> safe, being
laid up in perfect safety as a sure deposit in the everlasting
fidelity of God.&nbsp; It is on the safety of this deposit that
our whole life depends.&nbsp; If there were the slightest doubt
about it we should be like ships drifting on the wide ocean
without either chart, compass, or anchorage.&nbsp; But now we are
safe because indissolubly bound up with the Saviour, and so
completely is our life identified with Him that in the next verse
He is described as &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He holds
our life in His right hand.&nbsp; He is the source, the fountain,
and the main spring of it all, so that we can well understand the
words of St. John, &ldquo;He that hath the Son hath life.&rdquo;
<a name="citation34d"></a><a href="#footnote34d"
class="citation">[34d]</a></p>
<h3><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>DEPENDENT ON HIM</h3>
<p>There is a struggle in the human heart for independence.&nbsp;
The tendency of the day is to throw off all dependence, and, with
it, all submission.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I</i> will,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>I</i> choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>I</i> think,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>I</i> determine,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>I</i> am
resolved,&rdquo; is the self-sufficient language of these latter
days.&nbsp; Now such an one can never say, &ldquo;To me to live
is Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he say anything it should be,
&ldquo;To me to live is self!&rdquo;&nbsp; But see what a
contrast there is in the life of the believer.&nbsp; Turn only to
one passage in Galatians.&nbsp; There you find the
&ldquo;I&rdquo; crucified; &ldquo;I am crucified with
Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; But though the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is
crucified, there is a life that remains for &ldquo;Nevertheless I
live.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now what is the character of this abiding
life?&nbsp; The latter part of the verse describes it, &ldquo;Yet
not I, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words tell of
a life of habitual dependence.&nbsp; It all depends on the
in-dwelling Saviour.&nbsp; His in-dwelling, that is life, that is
the secret of everything.&nbsp; But how is this indwelling
realized?&nbsp; How is it appropriated or experienced?&nbsp; It
is clear that it cannot be known by the senses.&nbsp; We cannot
see, hear, or handle Him.&nbsp; We must not look for anything
material.&nbsp; Nor is it connected here with anything
Sacramental; but it is described as the unspeakable blessing of
an abiding faith, &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
Himself for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must not leave the passage without remarking two facts
respecting that love.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; It was shown in propitiation.&nbsp; St. Paul did not
merely say, &ldquo;Who loved me,&rdquo; but adds, &ldquo;Who gave
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Himself
for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many proofs of His love, but the
crowning act of all is propitiation.&nbsp; It is the ransom paid
in full that is the one hope for the captive, and the supreme
evidence of the Redeemer&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; The love was not merely for all, but according to
that passage, &ldquo;for <i>me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One individual
is a mere unit in a crowd, no more than a grain of sand in an
Egyptian desert; so that it seems a very easy thing for any one
person to be lost in the multitude.&nbsp; But it is the office of
God the Holy Ghost to apply the work wrought out for <i>all</i>
to the special need of <i>each one</i>.</p>
<h3>DEVOTED TO HIM</h3>
<p>St. Paul could say, &ldquo;To me to live is Christ,&rdquo; for
he could also say without hesitation that the one thought of his
life was his Saviour&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; He lived for one
object, and that one object is described as his life.&nbsp; Now
we hear a great deal of consecration in these days, and we cannot
hear too much, if only it is kept in its right place, for there
is far too little consecration to God amongst us.&nbsp;
Consecration is the surrender of the whole life to the
Lord.&nbsp; It is the setting the Lord always before us in all
that He calls us to do.&nbsp; We have been loved by Him, redeemed
by Him, called by Him, and saved by Him; so now we are His.&nbsp;
We belong to Him altogether.&nbsp; Our powers are no longer our
own, but our Lord&rsquo;s; our lives should be no longer occupied
for ourselves, but for our Lord; so that in us may be carried out
the purpose of redeeming love as described by St. Paul.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He died for all, that they which live should not <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them, and rose
again.&rdquo; <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a></p>
<p>Shall we live for ourselves or for His glory?&nbsp; For the
gratification of self, or for the happy, holy, sacred service of
Him to whom we owe all that we have, and all that we hope for,
our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ?</p>
<h2><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>THE
INDWELLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and
shall be in you.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. John</span>
xiv. 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this verse our Blessed Lord
spoke of the knowledge enjoyed by His people.&nbsp; He spoke of
the present, and the future; of that which they had then at the
time that He was with them, and of that which they were about to
enjoy after the Day of Pentecost, when He would be taken away
from them.&nbsp; With reference to the present He says &ldquo;He
dwelleth&rdquo; (or, is dwelling) with you, or amongst you; with
reference to the future He says &ldquo;He shall be in
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are clearly, therefore, two great
subjects to be considered, the knowledge enjoyed by the disciples
when the Lord Jesus was still upon earth, and the knowledge
enjoyed by all His people ever since the Day of Pentecost.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">When He was on
Earth</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye know Him for He dwelleth with
you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression does not describe an internal union within the
soul, but an external companionship.&nbsp; The meaning is the
same as when St. John said, &ldquo;There standeth one among you,
whom ye know not.&rdquo; <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; There they
were, a little company of disciples, and amongst them in the
midst of their society, in the <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>room where they were assembled, was
abiding, or dwelling, the Spirit of Truth.</p>
<p>Now what was the meaning of this declaration?&nbsp; Was it not
this?&nbsp; That the Holy Spirit was at that time dwelling
amongst them as embodied and manifested in the Person of the Lord
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Of Him it was said by John the Baptist
&ldquo;God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a>&nbsp; So it was said by St. Paul,
&ldquo;In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily.&rdquo; <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a>&nbsp; And by St. Peter we are taught
that He was anointed with the Holy Ghost, and God was with Him.
<a name="citation39c"></a><a href="#footnote39c"
class="citation">[39c]</a></p>
<p>Consider, then, the Lord Jesus Christ as God manifest in the
flesh, as the human manifestation of the mind and power of the
Holy Ghost, and you will see in a moment that while He was on
earth the Spirit of Truth was dwelling amongst the
disciples.&nbsp; Where the Lord Jesus was, there was the Spirit;
where He dwelt, there the Spirit dwelt; and when He and those
twelve disciples sat together at the Last Supper, He could say of
the Spirit of Truth, &ldquo;Ye know Him for He dwelleth with, or
among, you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Knowledge enjoyed by all
His People after His Departure</span>.</h3>
<p>It was to be very different afterwards.&nbsp; There is an
immense change when our Lord speaks of what should take place
after His departure.&nbsp; It is no longer &ldquo;with,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;in.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would be not merely present in
their company, but abiding in their souls.</p>
<p>In this promise, there are three things requiring our careful
notice.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; The promise applies not to a company, to a society,
to a Church, or to any body of men, but <i>to each
individual</i>.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit will not be merely <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>in the midst
of a congregation, but a sacred guest in each soul.&nbsp; You see
this very clearly in the history of the Day of Pentecost. <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; The Holy Spirit came on the
company, on the Church, for He filled all the house where they
were sitting.&nbsp; But besides that there was a separate
personal gift to each person present, for &ldquo;it sat upon each
of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; The sacred gift is no longer localized or specially
enjoyed in one place.&nbsp; So long as the Lord Jesus was amongst
them where He was, there was the Gift.&nbsp; But now, wherever
the believer is, there is the Gift.&nbsp; See the unspeakable
blessedness of this sacred promise.&nbsp; The gift of the Spirit
is not confined to this place or that.&nbsp; It is the
inestimable privilege of each individual believer wherever he is,
and in whatever position it may please God to cast his lot.&nbsp;
You may be cut off from the means of grace in which you have
delighted, but wherever you are, you are not cut off from the
Spirit of Truth, from the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, for He is
not limited to time, or place, or circumstance, and wherever you
go at the Lord&rsquo;s command, there you will carry His presence
with you.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; He dwells <i>within</i> the soul.</p>
<p>There is this great difference between His presence and that
of the most faithful and loving of friends.&nbsp; The friend can
only judge by the outside; the anxious look, the tear in the eye,
or the words of sorrow.&nbsp; But the Spirit of Truth is within,
and He takes note of the inner secrets of the soul.&nbsp; He does
not wait for any external evidence of what is passing.&nbsp; The
hidden springs of thought are all open to His eye: the secret
pain that is never breathed to any <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>one; the hidden hope that smoulders
in the heart; the subtle temptation that is beginning to grow up
unperceived, and the yearning of soul after a higher
life,&mdash;all these things are open to Him, and He, dwelling
within and knowing all that is passing within, can check, can
guide, can heal, can help, can supply any possible need
&ldquo;according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&rdquo;
<a name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"
class="citation">[41a]</a></p>
<p>There is no telling, then, the unspeakable blessing of the
Pentecostal gift, and we can perfectly understand why it was that
our Lord said &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But do we all desire it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course we do,&rdquo;
say some.&nbsp; But it is not at all a matter of course.&nbsp;
There was no room for Christ in the inn at Bethlehem, and there
is no room for the Spirit of Truth in many hearts.&nbsp; If He
dwells within your soul He will humble you and make you to
&ldquo;abhor yourself and repent in dust and ashes.&rdquo; <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; Do you desire that?&nbsp; If He
dwells within you, He will wean you from the world and teach you
to live as one looking for the Kingdom.&nbsp; Do you desire
that?&nbsp; If He dwells within you He will teach you to give up
your own will.&nbsp; Do you desire that?&nbsp; Do you desire
really to be led by the Spirit, taught by the Spirit to become a
humble, gentle, and submissive child of God?&nbsp; I fear there
are many who, when the whole subject is considered, are not
prepared to give Him an unreserved welcome, and would be tempted
to close the door of their hearts against His entrance.&nbsp; If
the door is opened by them at all, it is only set ajar, and not
thrown wide open that the King of Glory may enter in, in the
fulness of His power, and turn out everything that is at variance
with His will.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>But I
believe there are many who would hold nothing back and who long
above all things that the Spirit of Truth may take full
possession of their souls.&nbsp; Their difficulty is not that
they do not wish it, but that they can scarcely believe it
possible that He should ever dwell in such a heart as
theirs.&nbsp; They find so much sin there that they can scarcely
imagine it possible that the Holy Comforter should not be driven
from them by all that He sees within.&nbsp; No doubt there is
quite sufficient to drive Him grieved and displeased from His
resting-place, and if it were not for the everlasting covenant of
God, and the precious blood of Christ, I can perfectly understand
the impossibility of His making such a heart His
dwelling-place.&nbsp; But the atoning blood alters the whole
case.&nbsp; The blood of Christ breaks down every barrier.&nbsp;
It is a new and living way <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a> by which not only
may you enter boldly into the presence of God, but through which
the Spirit of God may enter your heart and take full possession
of it as His own abiding-place.</p>
<p>If you are longing to be filled with the Spirit, you must look
straight to that cross of Christ.&nbsp; You must remember the
fulness of the pardon.&nbsp; You must trust to that Atonement as
breaking down even the barrier raised by your own dark
corruption, and, pleading that precious blood, must open every
avenue of your soul to the Spirit of Truth, that He may enter in
and there reign supreme.</p>
<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>THE
WITNESS&mdash;THE LEADER&mdash;THE COMMANDER</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold, I have given Him for a witness to
the people, a leader and commander to the
people.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isa</span>. lv. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is often said that a living head
is essential to the well-being of a living Church.&nbsp; Nothing
can be clearer than the teaching of Scripture that our Living
Head is in heaven now, seated at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>It is as a Living Head that our Blessed Saviour is here
predicted.&nbsp; Three rich promises are made by God to every
hungering and thirsting heart&mdash;Life, a Covenant, and a
living Head.&nbsp; Life, for He says, &ldquo;Hear, and your soul
shall live.&rdquo;&nbsp; A covenant, for He says, &ldquo;I will
make an everlasting covenant with you;&rdquo; and a Head, for He
adds, in the words of our text, &ldquo;Behold I have given Him
for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question may arise, &ldquo;Who is it that is thus given
for a witness?&nbsp; Who is the person that the people are to
recognize as their leader and commander?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
prophecy says David.&nbsp; But David, we know, was a typical
character.&nbsp; He was not merely a king, but a type; a type of
Him who was to be both his son and his Lord.&nbsp; Accordingly we
are taught that the name David was applied to the Lord Jesus, for
we find the words applied by St. Paul to <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Christ and
His resurrection. <a name="citation44a"></a><a
href="#footnote44a" class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; We are there
taught that when God raised up Christ from the dead, He gave us
the sure mercies of David.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus Christ,
therefore, is the Witness, He is the Leader, and He the Commander
of His people.&nbsp; In other words the risen Redeemer is our
Living Head.</p>
<p>The text, therefore, directs us to His present action, not to
His death or even to His life before His death, but to His
present Headship at the right hand of God.&nbsp; He is</p>
<h3>A WITNESS</h3>
<p>One who bears a true and faithful testimony.&nbsp; This He did
in His life on earth, as we learn from His own words when He
stood before Pilate.&nbsp; &ldquo;To this end was I born, and for
this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness into
the truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation44b"></a><a
href="#footnote44b" class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; And this
same character He maintains in heaven, for at the opening of the
Book of Revelation we are taught to look for grace and peace
&ldquo;from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the first-begotten
from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth.&rdquo;
<a name="citation44c"></a><a href="#footnote44c"
class="citation">[44c]</a>&nbsp; It is clear that as the
&ldquo;first-begotten,&rdquo; that is, as the risen Saviour, He
now acts as a witness.</p>
<p>This is done in two ways.&nbsp; He is a witness to the world,
bearing witness to God&rsquo;s great plan of salvation.&nbsp; But
more than that He witnesses to the heart of each of His own
children, assuring them of His faithfulness, confirming them in
His truth, and doing what David prayed Him to do, &ldquo;Say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.&rdquo; <a name="citation44d"></a><a
href="#footnote44d" class="citation">[44d]</a>&nbsp; There is an
outer and an inner <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>witness; an outer witness in the power of His Spirit
accompanying His word, and an inner witness within the souls of
His own people; hidden from the world and known only to those who
enjoy it, that witness of which St. John spoke when he said,
&ldquo;He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
himself.&rdquo; <a name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a>&nbsp; And this may teach us an
important lesson respecting the true nature of faith.&nbsp; It is
faith when we receive the testimony of the Lord Jesus as an
undoubted truth, and, without questioning, simply believe
Him.&nbsp; There are difficult truths taught in His word, and
some strangely at variance with human opinion; but true faith
gives up all and trusts.&nbsp; It makes a complete surrender to
Jesus Christ, the faithful witness.</p>
<h3>HE IS A LEADER</h3>
<p>And when we speak of Him as a Leader, we must not connect His
office merely with the idea of war, for it is the office of peace
also.&nbsp; When our Lord compares Himself to the Shepherd He
says He &ldquo;leadeth them out.&rdquo; <a
name="citation45b"></a><a href="#footnote45b"
class="citation">[45b]</a>&nbsp; Nor is His office of a leader
given up even in the peaceful rest of Heaven.&nbsp; There is a
leading Hand even there, for when St. John was permitted to look
in and to see the great multitude before the Throne, the Angel
referred him to words from the blessed promise in Isaiah. <a
name="citation45c"></a><a href="#footnote45c"
class="citation">[45c]</a>&nbsp; In heaven, therefore, the
promise is both fulfilled and known.&nbsp; It is fulfilled, for
there the saints of God are refreshed by the living waters; and
it is known, for the Angel himself, while describing the joys of
heaven, calls attention to the ancient prophecy, and shows how <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>in the
peaceful scene around him it was receiving its complete
fulfilment.</p>
<p>Now what is implied when we are taught that the Lord Jesus is
a Leader for His people?&nbsp; It implies much more than
teaching, and therefore the office of the leader is far beyond
that of witness.&nbsp; It would be of but little use to explain
to a blind man the windings of some narrow path.&nbsp; But it
would be an act of great kindness to take him by the hand and
lead him.&nbsp; And this is what our Leader does for us, for He
says, &ldquo;I will bring the blind by a way they knew
not.&rdquo; <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a></p>
<p>Our proud hearts may dislike the dependent position of either
the feeble or the blind; but, whether we like it or no, we are
both blind and feeble, unable to trace our path amidst the
perplexities of life, and equally unable to move safely alone
even when the path may be discovered.&nbsp; It is, therefore, in
mercy and in tender love that God has given Him to be a Leader,
and our part is to accept the gift and trust Him.&nbsp; When we
are brought into perplexity, into one of those positions of life
where two ways seem to meet, we may fall down before Him as our
great Leader, and say, &ldquo;For thy name&rsquo;s sake, lead me
and guide me.&rdquo; <a name="citation46b"></a><a
href="#footnote46b" class="citation">[46b]</a>&nbsp; When we find
ourselves in slippery places and scarcely know how to stand, we
may come into His presence and cry, &ldquo;Hold Thou me up, and I
shall be safe.&rdquo; <a name="citation46c"></a><a
href="#footnote46c" class="citation">[46c]</a>&nbsp; When
perplexing doctrine is presented to us, and false teaching
abounds around us, we may spread out His word which contains His
testimony, and say, &ldquo;Shew me Thy ways, O Lord.&rdquo; <a
name="citation46d"></a><a href="#footnote46d"
class="citation">[46d]</a>&nbsp; And when we come to the valley
of the shadow of death, when no human hand can help us, and no
human sympathy reach our necessities, even then we <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>may be
perfectly sure that our great Leader will never leave us; but as
we part from all friends here on earth, and as all earthly helps
fade away, we may lean more simply and more heavily than ever on
Him and say, &ldquo;Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with
me.&rdquo; <a name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a></p>
<p>So again for the Church of Christ.&nbsp; Our lot is cast in
very perplexing times, and those who really care for the Church
of God must often have their hearts filled with deep
anxiety.&nbsp; It is a happy thing to know that God has given him
to be a Leader of the people, and &ldquo;Head over all things to
the Church.&rdquo; <a name="citation47b"></a><a
href="#footnote47b" class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; We may trust
Him, therefore, to take care of His own truth, and rest assured
that amidst all the perplexities of these latter days He will
guide His own people safe to the end, until every one of them
appeareth before God.</p>
<h3>HE IS A COMMANDER</h3>
<p>We cannot say of this office, as we did of the last, that it
belongs to peace, for it is one peculiar to war.&nbsp; The
commander is for the battle-field, and still more for the
well-arranged campaign.&nbsp; Thus our Lord is presented to us as
a Commander in the book of Revelation. <a
name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a>&nbsp; He then appears in His royal
character, and at the same time heading His army.&nbsp; He
encounters all the powers of the world, but he is surrounded by a
little company of faithful followers, and He leads them on to
victory.</p>
<p>The Church of God must be prepared for conflict.&nbsp; Till
the Lord comes sin will give the Church no peace.&nbsp; Till
Satan is trampled down under His feet, <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>he will never rest in his deadly
warfare against the Lord Jesus and His little flock.&nbsp; The
soldier of Christ must be a man of war.</p>
<p>The great Commander will have His own chosen and faithful
followers&mdash;&ldquo;they that are with Him are called, and
chosen, and faithful.&rdquo; <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; They are
marked from the world by a clear line of separation.&nbsp; They
bear His name; they wear His uniform; they rally round His
banner; they are not ashamed of His reproach; and wheresoever He
goeth there it is their joy to follow Him.&nbsp; There is no
service like His, no commander so perfect, no struggle so noble,
no victory so certain and so glorious.</p>
<p>If we really be amongst the chosen band of faithful followers,
our one standard in life must be the will of our great
Commander.&nbsp; We must be watching each signal from Him, and
owning no authority but His.&nbsp; From first to last our spirit
must be that of Saul of Tarsus, &ldquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have
me to do?&rdquo; <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a>&nbsp; This may sometimes imply a
painful surrender, a surrender of ease, and inclination, and,
hardest of all, of pride.&nbsp; But the soldier in the earthly
army yields at once to his commanding officer, and how much more
should we, when He has chosen us to be His people, blotted out
our sins by His blood, called us into His own fellowship, sealed
us with His seal, and made us heirs of His Kingdom?</p>
<h2><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>FAITH
AND EFFORT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our God shall fight for
us.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Neh</span>. iv. 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">can</span> imagine nothing better
calculated to make a people calm, peaceful, and courageous, than
to be able to say in faith, &ldquo;Our God shall fight for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we can say this, we may think on our country
and rest assured that, whatever happens, all is safe.&nbsp; If we
can say this, we may look upon God&rsquo;s people struggling for
His truth, sometimes sorely pressed and sometimes quite
disheartened; but when we look on Him whom God has given to be a
Leader and Commander of the people, we may take courage that all
will be well, for He is our God, and He will fight for us.&nbsp;
Or, we may look at our own personal difficulties, at the
temptation without by which we are surrounded, and the proneness
to yield within, which renders us perpetually liable to its
power; and sometimes we may be ready to ask the question, Can
such as we are ever gain the victory?&nbsp; But, if we can but
say in faith, &ldquo;Our God shall fight for us,&rdquo; then,
weak as we are, we may look forward to a triumph, and say even
beforehand, &ldquo;Thanks be to God which giveth us the
victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there are few cases in which this language of faith was
more appropriate than when originally spoken by Nehemiah.&nbsp;
Nehemiah was one of the <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>most beautiful characters to be met
with in all history.&nbsp; I know of no one in whom there was a
greater combination of practical, business-like habits, with
true, simple-minded, childlike faith.&nbsp; When acting as
cup-bearer to the King of Babylon, he heard of the desolation of
Jerusalem, and obtained permission to return thither in order to
rebuild the walls and restore the city.&nbsp; The Jews at the
time were so exceedingly feeble, that the onlookers laughed them
to scorn.&nbsp; But, when once the work was begun, contempt was
exchanged for indignation, and Sanballat with others
&ldquo;conspired all of them together to come and to fight
against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it was
that Nehemiah used these words for the great encouragement of all
who were working with him, and said, &ldquo;Our God shall fight
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while he thus spoke with the full assurance of confiding
faith, he was not led by that faith to negligence.&nbsp; True
faith never leads to negligence.&nbsp; It always stimulates
exertion and rouses men to hopeful energy.&nbsp; So it did in the
case of Nehemiah, for the same verse which contains the assurance
contains also the spirit of active preparation.&nbsp; We will
study the conduct of Nehemiah as furnishing an illustration of
the union of faith and effort, examining first his effort, then
his faith.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Effort made</span>.</h3>
<p>It was made under very discouraging circumstances.&nbsp; The
city was in ruins, the walls were in heaps, and there were only a
few restored captives to labour for their restoration.&nbsp; Now,
in what spirit did these feeble Jews rise to their work?</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; They all worked together.</p>
<p>There was just such an united and harmonious <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>action as we
long to witness in the Church of God.&nbsp; It is an old proverb
that &ldquo;union is strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this case the
whole wall was portioned out and all classes united.&nbsp; First
came the High Priest and his brethren, next the men of Jericho,
soon followed by the carpenters, the goldsmiths, and the
apothecaries.&nbsp; Then came the ruler of the half part of
Jerusalem, followed by Shallum and his daughters; further on we
read of Baruch, who set an example to the whole company, for he
<i>earnestly</i> repaired the portion entrusted to his care, till
at length the circuit was complete.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; They worked with a will.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as work without a will.&nbsp; There is
the dull, lazy work of the idle man, and the mechanical work of
those who take no interest in what they are about.&nbsp; Just as
in religion, there is the languid performance of a routine as
different as possible to the real wrestling with God in
faith.&nbsp; There is no soul in it, and who can wonder if there
is no result?&nbsp; In this case there was rapid result, and they
built the wall, and the reason is given, &ldquo;for the people
had a mind to work.&rdquo; <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a>&nbsp; An important
lesson this for every Christian effort.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; They made real sacrifices for their work.&nbsp; It
must have been a sore inconvenience to these men to leave their
own occupations and to labour on the wall; but they laboured
night and day till the wall rose from its ruins.&nbsp; Oh, that
we had more of this spirit in the Church of God!&nbsp; Would that
we knew better how to give to Him so as to pinch ourselves; to
give our time, our money, our painstaking, our real self-denying
work, in order to glorify God, and show that we live not unto
ourselves, but unto Him that died for us and rose again.</p>
<h3><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Their Faith</span>.</h3>
<p>This showed itself in three ways.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; In prayer.</p>
<p>Nehemiah was a man of prayer.&nbsp; When any trouble arose,
his heart turned as if by an holy instinct to God, and so, when
Tobiah mocked their efforts, Nehemiah gave no rough answer, but
he turned his heart upwards and said, &ldquo;Hear, O our God, for
we are despised.&rdquo; <a name="citation52a"></a><a
href="#footnote52a" class="citation">[52a]</a>&nbsp; How much
bitter strife would be avoided in the world if men acted like
Nehemiah, and, instead of retorting, spread out their
provocations before God.</p>
<p>But the conduct of the opponents soon turned from mockery to
war, and there was a plan to attack the rising walls.&nbsp; But
the attack was met just in the same way as the insult.&nbsp; In
both cases he gave himself to prayer.&nbsp; I cannot imagine a
better illustration of the praying believer than the words in
verse 9, &ldquo;Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and
set a watch against them day and night.&rdquo;&nbsp; They heard
of the conspiracy, and at once spread the intelligence before
God; but, having done so, they did not consider that prayer
superseded effort, but day and night they set their watch on the
walls.&nbsp; Had they watched without praying, they would have
been trusting to their own forethought; and had they prayed
without watching, they would have tempted God to leave
them.&nbsp; But they watched and they prayed, and they prayed and
they watched, and so they acted in the spirit of the words in
aftertimes spoken to us, &ldquo;Watch and Pray.&rdquo; <a
name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b"
class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Their faith showed itself also in the recognition of
what God had done for them.&nbsp; Faith not only asks God&rsquo;s
help, but acknowledges it.&nbsp; It gives Him thanks <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>for His
action as well as asks Him to act; so when the danger was past we
find Nehemiah ascribing it all to the good hand of God on his
efforts.&nbsp; He did not say, &ldquo;When we had defeated their
plans,&rdquo; but &ldquo;When God had brought their counsel to
nought.&rdquo; <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a></p>
<p>(3) Faith looks forward to the future.&nbsp; When the workmen
were all at their posts; when the builders laboured, every one
having his sword girded by his side; when the trumpeter stood by
the chief, ready at any moment to sound the alarm; when the voice
of prayer had been heard day and night all along the line of the
rising walls; when all had been done that man could do&mdash;then
the heart rose high above all that man had done, and in calm,
confident trust, Nehemiah assures the people, saying, &ldquo;Our
God shall fight for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had made preparation, but
he trusted to God for victory.&nbsp; He was at the head of a
feeble people, but he was the servant of the Most High God.&nbsp;
He knew that the battle was not to the strong, nor the race to
the swift; so he rested his hope on the strong hand of his God,
and in simple faith he trusted Him to give the victory.</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>THE
JOY OF THE LORD</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By whom also we have access by faith into
this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of
God.&nbsp; And not only so, but we glory in tribulations
also.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rom</span>. v. 2, 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> joy of the Lord is a subject
that goes to the heart of many.&nbsp; Some are rejoicing in the
Lord, while others are longing to be partakers of it; it is a
gift after which their heart is yearning.</p>
<p>Let us consider the real foundation of true, solid,
well-founded joy.&nbsp; In these two verses there is a
description of the joy and its power.&nbsp; There is the joy, for
&ldquo;we rejoice in hope of the glory of God,&rdquo; and there
is the power of that joy, for it rises above the troubles of
life, and we rejoice &ldquo;even in tribulation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is, therefore, such a bright hope of the coming glory, that
we may go on our way with a thankful heart, rejoicing in the
Lord; and there is such a manifestation of the love of Christ in
the soul by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the distress of
tribulation is overpowered, and even in the midst of sorrow there
may be an abiding joyfulness in Christ Jesus the Lord.</p>
<p>Observe the foundation of this joy, and see how it is the
consequence of our sure standing in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; When we
rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and rejoice even in
tribulation, this joy is the consequence of a previous
transaction, and the result of <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>our occupying a new position.&nbsp;
We have had access, or admission, and are now standing in His
grace.&nbsp; It is the standing in that grace that is the
foundation of the joy of hope.&nbsp; This leads us to the
question, &ldquo;What is the grace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;grace&rdquo; has different meanings in
Scripture.&nbsp; Sometimes it means the inward work of God the
Holy Ghost in the soul, as when it says, &ldquo;Grow in
grace.&rdquo; <a name="citation55a"></a><a href="#footnote55a"
class="citation">[55a]</a>&nbsp; But this cannot be our
standing-ground, for the simple reason that it is imperfect and
variable.&nbsp; But this is not the only meaning of the word, or
nearly so, for it is used for any great gift of love and mercy
bestowed in God&rsquo;s free favour on His people.&nbsp; We have
to consider what is the free gift or favour into which we have
had access, and which is now our standing-ground.&nbsp; This
question the context must decide; and it seems to me impossible
to study that context, without coming to the conclusion that the
grace here referred to is that which must ever be the real
resting place for those who are convinced of sin, a righteousness
imputed in the free grace of God. <a name="citation55b"></a><a
href="#footnote55b" class="citation">[55b]</a></p>
<p>This, then, is the grace in which we stand, the grace of
imputation, the gracious gift of a righteousness reckoned,
counted, or imputed to us when we do not deserve it; the
marvellous mercy through which we are accounted righteous,
accepted as righteous, beloved as righteous, and finally saved as
righteous, although we are not really so in fact, and although we
are conscious in our own hearts of matter for the most profound
humiliation before God.&nbsp; Who can wonder that we rejoice in
hope when we are placed in mercy on such a standing-ground as
that?</p>
<p>This, you observe, is a work <i>for</i> us, and not <i>in</i>
us, and therefore never varies.&nbsp; The work <i>in</i> us is <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>perpetually
changing.&nbsp; It is a progressive work, and its progress is
sometimes much more rapid than at others.&nbsp; But the work
<i>for</i> us does not go up and down with the work <i>in</i> us;
it is unchangeable, like God Himself.&nbsp; The righteousness
imputed is the righteousness of God, and therefore perfect and
unchangeable.&nbsp; It changeth not for the simple reason that He
changeth not, and therefore always, in cloud as well as sunshine,
in dark days as well as bright, in the hour of tribulation as
well as in the season of unmixed prosperity, in the times of
deepest humiliation as well as in those of emotion and
encouragement, the justified believer may rejoice in Him, and
triumph in the God of his salvation.&nbsp; It is this that gives
its security to hope, this that makes us sure of its never
failing.&nbsp; If we were relying on all the varied changes of
our own feelings, there might be joy one day and despair the
next; but while we stand in the grace of imputed righteousness,
our hope has a foundation that can never give way, and therefore
we may accept the joy without a fear, and rejoice in hope of the
glory of God.</p>
<p>What is the great principle within the soul which constitutes
our standing in this grace?</p>
<p>To this question we shall find an answer in the words of St.
Paul, &ldquo;Thou standest by faith.&rdquo; <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; And this is exactly what is
taught us in this passage.&nbsp; In verse 1, we are taught that
it is by faith that we are justified; and then, in verse 2, we
learn that it is by faith that we have access into this grace
wherein we stand.&nbsp; From first to last, therefore, it is a
matter of faith.&nbsp; The whole secret of our standing, and of
the joy that follows from it, is found in that one word
&ldquo;trust.&rdquo;&nbsp; Trust the Lord Jesus Christ as your
finished <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>Sacrifice and your living Lord, and you stand on the
rock.&nbsp; Let your trust rest on anything else, on your
feelings, your thoughts, your experience, your intentions, or
your religious efforts, and you will be no better than men
endeavouring to walk steadily on the waves of the sea.&nbsp; But
trust Christ <i>as</i> you are, <i>where</i> you are, and that
without putting even your own trust between you and Him, and you
may go on your way rejoicing in Him, and need never cease to give
thanks for a foundation so solid and a grace so free.</p>
<h2><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>THE
WORK OF THE LORD</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be ye steadfast, immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labour is not in vain in the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">Cor</span>. xv. 58.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have lately studied &ldquo;the
joy of the Lord,&rdquo; and now I am anxious that our thoughts
should be turned to another subject, which is much more
intimately connected with it than many seem to suppose, that is,
the work of the Lord.&nbsp; The joy of the Lord imparts strength
for service, and the service of the Lord increases joy.&nbsp;
There is action and reaction between the two.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">What is meant by the Work of the
Lord</span>?</h3>
<p>It is <i>work</i>&mdash;work with all the self-denial that
accompanies steady work.</p>
<p>It is work <i>for</i> the Lord.&nbsp; When we say that a
father works for his family, or a servant for his master, it does
not mean that such an one simply goes about his own business, but
it does mean that he has a particular person in view, and that he
is working for him.&nbsp; We are such poor, frail creatures that
there is a constant tendency to admit bye motives in our
work.&nbsp; I know how hard it is to preserve a single eye to the
glory of God.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s own reputation and the great
pleasure of one&rsquo;s own success have a constant tendency to
introduce false motives.&nbsp; What we want is to lose sight of
self altogether, and to remember that if we <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>are doing the
work <i>of</i> the Lord, we are doing it <i>for</i> the Lord.</p>
<p>It is work <i>from</i> the Lord.&nbsp; It is the work to which
the Lord has appointed each of us.&nbsp; When God called Barnabus
and Paul, He said, &ldquo;Separate them for the work whereunto I
have called them.&rdquo; <a name="citation59a"></a><a
href="#footnote59a" class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; Now we are
not called to the Apostleship, but I believe there is not an
individual amongst us who is not called by God to a certain work
in His service.&nbsp; The Church of God is said to be
&ldquo;compacted by that which every joint supplieth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a>&nbsp; There is not, therefore, a joint
in the whole body that is not to supply something.&nbsp; All who
are in Christ Jesus are the children of God, and all are called
to work in His service, the strong man in the fulness of his
strength, or the suffering invalid laid low with broken
health.</p>
<p>This, then, being the character of the work of the Lord, let
us turn to the encouragement which God has given, and the root
from which it springs.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Encouragement</span>.</h3>
<p>There are some things in our Christian life which we think,
some which we hope, and some which we know.&nbsp; We know some,
for they are assured to us in God&rsquo;s word, and we are fully
persuaded that His word is true.&nbsp; Now here is one of the
things we know, know as a matter of certainty without the
possibility of doubt.&nbsp; We know that our labour is not in
vain in the Lord.&nbsp; It may often appear to us exceedingly
feeble and defective: we may be ashamed and humbled at its
multiplied shortcomings: we may look back upon it honeycombed, as
it were, by mistakes: we may be conscious that we have left
undone those things that we ought to have done, and we may be
painfully aware that nothing has been done as it ought <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>to have been
done for God, but still we are assured that it will not be in
vain.&nbsp; When Samuel was but a child, &ldquo;the Lord was with
him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground,&rdquo; <a
name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a> and we may be sure that He will not
let one word spoken in His name fall to the ground now.&nbsp; If
the Lord is with you, no one thing that you ever do for Him will
be in vain.&nbsp; You may not see the fruit of it, or if you do
it may be after years of waiting, but the Lord knows all about
it.&nbsp; He sees exactly what you are doing, or saying, or
giving, or praying, and the book of remembrance is written before
Him.&nbsp; You yourself may be one of God&rsquo;s hidden ones,
and in the day when He makes up His jewels, <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a> you may meet then with others, hidden
like yourself, to whom your labour, however feeble, has been
blessed in His mercy.&nbsp; Cleave, then, to the work of the Lord
without wavering.&nbsp; Let no discouragements dishearten you,
hold steadily on your way, faint yet pursuing, being perfectly
assured that what God has promised He is able also to perform,
and that even your poor service will not be in vain in the
Lord.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Root from which all Such Work must
spring</span>.</h3>
<p>It is not all kinds of labour to which the promise is
attached, for there is a great deal of labour that is altogether
in vain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except the Lord build the house, they
labour in vain that build it.&rdquo; <a name="citation60c"></a><a
href="#footnote60c" class="citation">[60c]</a>&nbsp; And the
distinction is very clearly taught us here, for the work here
spoken of is a labour &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; It teaches
how work is the consequence of union; that we do not do the work
of the Lord in order that by doing it we may attain to union, but
that the union comes first and the work of the Lord follows as
its result.&nbsp; There <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>will be no fruit on the branch if
there is not first a union with the vine.&nbsp; There is no hope,
therefore, of any man winning to himself a union with Christ by
any amount of painstaking in work.&nbsp; If your heart is
yearning for that union, you must accept it as a free gift
because Christ Jesus, the Son of God, has redeemed you by His own
most precious blood, and you must do so just as you are, without
waiting for even one more effort in His service.&nbsp; You must
be &ldquo;in the Lord&rdquo; before you can &ldquo;labour in the
Lord,&rdquo; and that union must be the free gift of His
unmerited grace.&nbsp; You must be created in Him unto good works
before you will do anything for His glory. <a

62</span>CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE IN THE CONFIRMATION OF FAITH</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because Thou hast been my help, therefore
in the shadow of Thy wings will I rejoice.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Psa</span>. lxiii. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">wish</span> to speak on the important
use of Christian experience in the confirmation of faith.&nbsp; I
say in the confirmation of faith, for there is the widest
possible difference between confirmation and commencement.&nbsp;
Experience may confirm the faith when it already exists, but the
faith must obviously be there before there can be any experience
of its result.</p>
<p>At the outset of our Christian course we have nothing to do
but throw ourselves absolutely in naked trust on the sure
promises of the covenant of God, and rest exclusively on what He
has done and promised.&nbsp; We have nothing then to do with our
own history, our own feelings, or our own progress, it is Christ
and Christ alone on whom the soul must rest for life.&nbsp; And
so, if we look to the real foundation of faith, it must be to the
last day of our pilgrimage.&nbsp; It is a fatal-moment for us if
we are led to look away for a single moment from Him.&nbsp; But
at the same time we must remember that we are not always at the
beginning of our Christian life.&nbsp; One who has trusted the
Lord Jesus Christ and walked with Him for many years is not in
the same position as one who is to-day seeking Him for the first
time.&nbsp; He has had the experience of <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the
loving-kindness of the Lord.&nbsp; He has never found Him to fail
in any of the anxieties of his life, and if he could trust many
years ago when he had nothing but the bare promise, how much more
may he trust the Saviour now when the truth of His word has been
tried and tested in all the varied experiences of life?</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ is described as &ldquo;a sure
foundation;&rdquo; <a name="citation63a"></a><a
href="#footnote63a" class="citation">[63a]</a> sure, because He
is the foundation laid by God; sure, because of His own eternal
Godhead; sure, therefore, as an object of simple trust before a
person has had any experience of His grace.&nbsp; To the
trembling sinner who has hitherto been a total stranger to Him,
and has never known anything of His love, even to him He is a
sure foundation, and though knowing Him only through the word,
that trembling sinner may come to Him and trust.&nbsp; But
according to that same verse He is also a tried foundation.&nbsp;
He has been tried by the whole church of God for eighteen
centuries and has never once been found to fail any one that has
come to Him in faith.&nbsp; He has been tried by us who have
known Him for the greater part of our lives, and we are not to
ignore all He has done for us, but say, as St. John did, not
merely that we have believed, but that &ldquo;we have known and
believed the love that God hath towards us.&rdquo; <a
name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a></p>
<p>Now this is the principle of the text.&nbsp; The Psalm was
written when David was in great trouble, having taken flight from
Saul in the wilderness of Judah.&nbsp; He was there hidden in
such caves as Adullam, and cut off from the sanctuary of
God.&nbsp; But it is a very cheerful and thankful Psalm.&nbsp; He
was not downhearted because of his troubles, but he had such an
assurance of the loving-kindness of the Lord that his heart was
full of praise.&nbsp; He could praise Him, and <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>that with
joyful lips, even in the wilderness.&nbsp; The reason was that he
could trust Him, and though he was only a young man his trust had
been confirmed by experience.&nbsp; He had been in difficulty
almost the whole time since his call, but he had found a strong
arm with him all the way, and therefore he said, &ldquo;Because
thou has been my help, therefore in the shadow of Thy wings will
I rejoice.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this verse there are two things to be
observed&mdash;</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Thankful Recognition of Help
already given</span>.</h3>
<p>The Lord had helped him through many difficulties and he
thankfully recognized the help.&nbsp; We do not know to what
particular act of help he referred.&nbsp; It may have been to his
victory over Goliath, or to the escape from the javelin of
Saul.&nbsp; Or it may be to the daily, hourly help given to his
own soul in all the difficulties of his situation; to that help
which finds no place in history, but which is the unceasing
source of life and strength to the child of God.&nbsp; But
whatever was the peculiar character of the help, it is perfectly
clear that it was accepted and recognized.&nbsp; He asked for
help, he found it, he acknowledged it, and he was thankful for
it.</p>
<p>Let us learn the lesson that we should not be always praying
for help, and fearing to acknowledge it when given.&nbsp; It is
our privilege to ask for the gift, but it is also both our
privilege and duty to acknowledge it.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Joyful Assurance for the
Future</span>.</h3>
<p>He knew that he believed in a God that changeth not, just as
we believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is &ldquo;the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever,&rdquo; <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> and the result was the assurance that
He who had helped him <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>thus far would help him to the
end.&nbsp; He knew that his God would not change, and therefore
he was happy and confident though he was in &ldquo;a dry and
thirsty land.&rdquo; <a name="citation65a"></a><a
href="#footnote65a" class="citation">[65a]</a>&nbsp; His joy did
not depend on circumstances, but on God, and being confident in
His unchanging grace he could be happy anywhere.&nbsp; He used to
delight in the Sanctuary, and we read in verse 2 how he had there
seen in his own soul God&rsquo;s power and glory.&nbsp; But the
same Lord who had helped him in the Sanctuary would help him also
in the cave, and therefore he was not an unhappy man even in the
wilderness, but he said, &ldquo;Because Thy loving-kindness is
better than life, my lips shall praise Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was no new principle in his mind, for we find him
acting on it when he was quite a youth.&nbsp; It was the
principle that carried him into the conflict with Goliath, for
when Saul dissuaded him from the attempt, he said, &ldquo;The
Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the
paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this
Philistine.&rdquo; <a name="citation65b"></a><a
href="#footnote65b" class="citation">[65b]</a>&nbsp; Thus the
recognition of past help ought to lead to confident trust.&nbsp;
If we have found help actually given, if we have reason to
believe that God is helping now, we may boldly look forward into
the future, and be perfectly confident that He will help to the
end.</p>
<h2><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>THE
COMING OF THE LORD</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Practical
Effect of this Blessed Hope on the Life and Character</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts:
for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">St. James</span> v. 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hope of the near approach of
the Lord&rsquo;s coming should lead us to sit light to the world
and the things of it.&nbsp; There is no greater temptation
besetting our path than that of becoming entangled in the things
of the world.&nbsp; We are for ever spinning cobwebs for our own
bondage, and being then caught in our own web.&nbsp; Hence the
importance of the weaning power of the blessed hope of the near
coming of our Lord and Saviour.&nbsp; This applies in sorrow.</p>
<p>There were sorrows in the days of St. Paul, just as there are
now, and he never taught us not to weep.&nbsp; What he did teach
was that we &ldquo;should not sorrow as those that have no
hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; The character of the sorrow may be
changed.&nbsp; And what was the power that should thus change the
character of grief?&nbsp; The next verse supplies the
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;For if we believe that Jesus died and rose
again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
Him.&rdquo; <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a>&nbsp; We may look forward, therefore,
to His speedy return, when <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the graves of those who are in Christ
shall open, and when all sorrow will be lost for eternity in the
blessed privilege of being &ldquo;ever with the lord.&rdquo; <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a>&nbsp; Is not such a hope enough to
change the character of grief?</p>
<p>This blessed hope changes also the character of our joy.</p>
<p>Just as it gives a tone to sorrow, so also it does to
joy.&nbsp; It makes it sober and solid.&nbsp; It gives it a
quiet, peaceful, abiding character.&nbsp; Turn to the words of
St. Paul.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I
say, Rejoice.&rdquo; <a name="citation67b"></a><a
href="#footnote67b" class="citation">[67b]</a>&nbsp; And observe
the verse that follows: &ldquo;Let your moderation be known unto
all men.&nbsp; The Lord is at hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let your joy be
the sober joy of men who believe that the coming of the Lord is
at hand; the calm, well-assured, abiding joy of those who, being
in the Lord, are persuaded that they will be with the Lord for
ever.</p>
<p>And the same effect will follow with reference to all our
possessions.</p>
<p>Let no one suppose we are not to prize those precious gifts
which God has given us.&nbsp; Ought we to think lightly of money,
time, influence, power?&nbsp; By no means; but if we believe that
the coming of the Lord is near we must sit light to it all, for
it will all soon give place to the glories of His kingdom.&nbsp;
Remember St. Paul&rsquo;s thrilling words: &ldquo;The time is
short,&rdquo; <a name="citation67c"></a><a href="#footnote67c"
class="citation">[67c]</a> and the exhortation that follows to
&ldquo;use this world, as not abusing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we believe that the Lord&rsquo;s coming is near we must
wake up and trim our lamps.</p>
<p>We must never forget that real, true believers may grow cold,
and dull, and sleepy.&nbsp; Thus even the wise virgins were
asleep when the Bridegroom came.&nbsp; But <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>they were
thoroughly prepared, so they were up in a moment when they heard
the cry, and, having trimmed their lamps, were ready.&nbsp; Now,
the thought of His appearing should have this effect on
ourselves.&nbsp; Who is there amongst us that does not want to be
quickened; to be aroused to fresh energy for God; to have the
soul filled with a holy fervour, and the whole heart glowing with
the love of Christ?&nbsp; Who is there that should not desire to
respond with every faculty he possesses to the stirring appeal of
St. Paul: &ldquo;And that, knowing the time, that now it is high
time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than
when we believed.&nbsp; The night is far spent, the day is at
hand.&rdquo; <a name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a>&nbsp; Shall we sleep on as if the old
world were going on for ever?&nbsp; Do we really believe that
&ldquo;the Bridegroom cometh,&rdquo; <a name="citation68b"></a><a
href="#footnote68b" class="citation">[68b]</a> and shall we not
trim our lamps without one moment&rsquo;s delay in order that
when He comes He may find them burning brightly to His glory?</p>
<p>If we are looking for the speedy coming of the Lord, it should
lead to a calm, happy, peaceful hope in the midst of the turmoils
of the latter days.</p>
<p>There is nothing to lead us to expect a calm termination to
the present state of things.&nbsp; Our Lord when He comes will
come riding, as it were, on the whirlwind and the storm.&nbsp; It
is a very common thing to find a bar with heavy breakers on it at
the mouth of the finest harbours, and so we must be prepared for
a stormy sea as we enter the haven of rest.&nbsp; Our Lord taught
this very clearly when He said, &ldquo;There shall be signs in
the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth
distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves
roaring.&rdquo; <a name="citation68c"></a><a href="#footnote68c"
class="citation">[68c]</a>&nbsp; And now observe <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the effect of
these events on different characters.&nbsp; Through the world at
large they produce what may be called a
panic&mdash;&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s hearts failing them for
fear.&rdquo; <a name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a>&nbsp; But how is it to be with the
people of God?&nbsp; Are their hearts to fail them for
fear?&nbsp; No, for we read, &ldquo;When these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads.&rdquo; <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a>&nbsp; They are not to be bowed down,
but to hold their head erect, and with a confident spirit to look
up full of hope.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; What is it that is to make
so vast a difference between the two characters?&nbsp; How can we
explain the contrast?&nbsp; It is all explained in the latter
part of that verse&mdash;&ldquo;For your redemption draweth
nigh.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is perfectly clear that by redemption is
here meant the final deliverance, for in the previous verse <a
name="citation69c"></a><a href="#footnote69c"
class="citation">[69c]</a> we read of the final coming of the
Deliverer.&nbsp; That calm peace, therefore, is the blessed
result of a blessed hope.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s people will know that
the Deliverer is at hand, and therefore will not be afraid.&nbsp;
They will believe God&rsquo;s Holy Word, and therefore what
alarms others will cheer them.&nbsp; The same storm which sinks
the great ironclads outside will bring their little bark into
harbour.&nbsp; They will know what it all means, and, with
God&rsquo;s Word in their hand, they will know who is reigning,
and will see in all that is frightening others the predicted
signs of His near approach.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">One Word in Conclusion</span>.</h3>
<p>The word &ldquo;redemption&rdquo; has a double sense in common
use.&nbsp; It is sometimes used for atonement or propitiation
simply, and sometimes for the great deliverance which is the
consequence of the great propitiation.&nbsp; It is clear that in
this passage it is used for deliverance.&nbsp; But another thing
is equally clear, <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>namely, this&mdash;that we shall never be able to rest
in the hope of the deliverance unless we are first taught to rest
for forgiveness on the completed propitiation.&nbsp; Redemption
by power is the consequence of redemption by blood.&nbsp; It is
the redemption by power of which the Lord said &ldquo;He draweth
nigh;&rdquo; but we shall never be able to lift up our heads, and
look up in joy to the prospect, unless we first know in our own
souls the unspeakable blessing of that redemption by blood which
has long since been completed for ever.&nbsp; It is only when we
know Jesus Christ and Him crucified that we can look up in calm,
peaceful confidence to Jesus Christ and Him glorified.</p>
<h2><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;WITH&rdquo; AND &ldquo;BY&rdquo;</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when they were come, and had gathered
the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with
them, and how He had opened the door of faith onto the
Gentiles.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Acts</span> xiv.
27.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few institutions of
greater antiquity than the missionary meeting.&nbsp; It is truly
apostolic in its origin.&nbsp; The first such meeting of which we
read was held at Antioch after the return of St. Paul from his
first missionary journey.&nbsp; It was from Antioch he set off,
having been commended by the brethren to the grace of God; and it
was at Antioch, after his return, that he gathered together the
Church and rehearsed to them all that God had done with them in
his journey.&nbsp; This is the great subject of his address, and
will suggest three subjects of inquiry for ourselves.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">What had been done</span>?</h3>
<p>In the first place, the door of faith had been opened to the
Gentiles.&nbsp; Surely by &ldquo;the door of faith&rdquo; we must
understand that &ldquo;new and living way&rdquo; of which we read
in Hebrews. <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; And what is that way?&nbsp; Is
not this explained by the previous verse, &ldquo;Having,
therefore, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the free access to the throne of Grace
through the finished, final propitiation, there described as
&ldquo;the blood of Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; When He <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>died, the
veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,
and the mercy-seat was laid open to the sinner drawing near in
faith, and the invitation was proclaimed to all.&nbsp; The throne
of righteousness became the throne of mercy, and the throne of
judgment became approachable even to the sinner, for it was
transformed into a throne of grace.</p>
<p>This is the door of faith that had been opened to the
Gentiles, and it is very difficult for us to realize all that was
involved in such a fact.&nbsp; There was a middle wall of
partition between Jew and Gentile which kept them as wide asunder
as if there had been no common Saviour.&nbsp; But now St. Paul
reported that the middle wall had been broken down. <a
name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a"
class="citation">[72a]</a>&nbsp; Every stone of it had been swept
away, and, according to the covenant of God, all were invited as
one flock around one Shepherd.</p>
<p>But this was not all that had been done.&nbsp; The great work
of that missionary journey was the turning of the hearts of both
Jews and Gentiles to enter in by that open door.&nbsp; It is one
thing to set a door open before a person, but often a much more
difficult thing to induce him to enter in.&nbsp; Now the great
result of this journey was that many precious souls were brought
in through the open door, and in Christ Jesus were saved.&nbsp;
This was the work of which St. Paul gave an account on his return
to Antioch.&nbsp; If he mentioned individuals he doubtless told
them of Sergius Paulus, the Roman pro-consul at Paphos, that
&ldquo;prudent man,&rdquo; <a name="citation72b"></a><a
href="#footnote72b" class="citation">[72b]</a> one of the first
converts given to the Apostle.&nbsp; Then, again, he doubtless
told them of the great multitude both of the Jews and also of the
Greeks in Iconium who believed. <a name="citation72c"></a><a
href="#footnote72c" class="citation">[72c]</a>&nbsp; And if he
were asked as to the reality of the work in their souls, he
doubtless told <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>them of the beautiful character of the Christians in the
other Antioch, Antioch of Pisidia, of whom it is said, &ldquo;the
disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;
<a name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>They had, indeed, entered in by the open door.&nbsp; They had
tasted the joy of the living way, they had been brought under the
shadow of the mercy-seat.&nbsp; They had sat down under His
shadow with great delight, and had found the fruit sweet to their
taste.&nbsp; So marvellous had been the change that the very men
who before this memorable journey had been living, some in Jewish
hostility, and some in heathen abomination, were now happy, holy,
thankful believers, and were actually filled with the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; We see, then, what had been done.&nbsp; The next
question is&mdash;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Who was the Doer</span>?</h3>
<p>St. Paul and St. Barnabas were the principal agents, and of
these St. Paul was the chief speaker, but it was not he who
changed the hearts or filled the disciples with joy and with the
Holy Ghost.&nbsp; So he did not tell what <i>he</i> had done, but
what God had done.&nbsp; The drawing of the sinner, whether Jew
or Gentile, into the new or living way was a Divine act.&nbsp; To
open the heart required a Divine power as much as to open the
door.&nbsp; It is important for us clearly to bear in mind this
principle, that the power to enter in is of itself the gift of
God&mdash;that we must trust Him not only to save us when we have
entered in, but to enable us to enter in; not only to show mercy
on us when we have come near to Him, but to draw us near by His
own Spirit.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">In what Way did the Lord make
use of Human Agency</span>?</h3>
<p>There are two expressions employed which throw great light on
the subject.&nbsp; In this verse we read of <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the things
which God had done <i>with</i> them, and the same expression
occurs in Acts xv. 4.&nbsp; But if we pass on to Acts xv., we
find it stated that &ldquo;God had wrought upon the Gentiles
<i>by</i> them.&rdquo; <a name="citation74a"></a><a
href="#footnote74a" class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; The one
expression implies companionship, the other
instrumentality.&nbsp; Consider them separately.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; &ldquo;With.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea is that throughout the journey our Lord was literally
fulfilling His promise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am with you alway.&rdquo;
<a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; They went out to preach in His
name and He went with them, as their constant, never-failing,
though invisible, companion and friend.&nbsp; Thus, while they
were acting, He was acting also.&nbsp; The two were acting
together, and so fulfilling the one purpose of God.&nbsp; The
action of the Lord was giving effect to the action of the
preacher, though in some cases it was quite independent of
it.&nbsp; Take the case of Lydia as an illustration. <a
name="citation74c"></a><a href="#footnote74c"
class="citation">[74c]</a>&nbsp; St. Paul preached to that little
company assembled at the place of prayer by the riverside at
Phillipi.&nbsp; There was the action of the preacher.&nbsp; But
now look at the action of the Lord working with him.&nbsp; By His
fore-seeing providence He had brought Lydia from her home at
Thyatira, and by His guiding Spirit had brought St. Paul from his
work in Asia Minor.&nbsp; It was He that brought them both to the
same spot on that Sabbath morning.&nbsp; Then, again, while St.
Paul was preaching the Lord was acting, for He was acting with
His servant, first by the preparatory leading of His providence,
and afterwards by the heart-opening movement of the Holy
Ghost</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; And this leads me to the other expression,
&ldquo;<i>by</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This expresses something different
to companionship, for it teaches that in thus drawing sinners to
Himself <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>He
makes use of men as instruments.&nbsp; In the case of Lydia the
Lord opened her heart, but the things which were spoken by St.
Paul were the instrument which God employed to lead her to the
faith.&nbsp; It was not without instrumentality, but by it, that
God acted.&nbsp; It is important to bear this in mind&mdash;that
human instrumentality is not in antagonism to faith.&nbsp; We
must remember the &ldquo;by&rdquo; as well as the
&ldquo;with,&rdquo; and that when God has given means, we do not
honour Him by neglecting or ignoring them.&nbsp; St. Paul was
most anxious to urge on the Corinthians that it was God alone who
gave the increase, but while he did so he was not deterred from
adding that he had planted and Apollos watered. <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; We know that God is a Sovereign,
and that He, if He pleased, could gather in the whole company of
His elect without the use of any one man to work for Him; but we
know also that &ldquo;by us&rdquo; the preaching is to be fully
known, and we are fully persuaded that if we are to look for a
harvest we must both plant and water.</p>
<h2><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>THE
STIRRING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the Lord stirred up the spirit of
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the
spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the
spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did
work in the house of the Lord of Hosts, their
God.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hag</span>. i. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Let us</span> consider this stirring of
the will, and then the great need of it even amongst the faithful
people of God.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; We read a great deal in Scripture of a movement in
the will, as we know in practical life, how we ourselves are
moved, or aroused on many occasions.&nbsp; We know what it is to
be like Peter, who was asleep in the prison till the Angel of the
Lord &ldquo;smote him on the side, and raised him up, saying,
Arise up quickly.&rdquo; <a name="citation76a"></a><a
href="#footnote76a" class="citation">[76a]</a>&nbsp; We are often
aroused to make an <i>effort</i> which we never thought of
before, and our whole soul is on fire to be working with a holy
enthusiasm for God.</p>
<p>Now this stirring of the spirit is the act of God
Himself.&nbsp; I am quite aware that there are passages in which
man is described as stirring himself, as for example,
&ldquo;There is none that calleth upon Thy name, that stirreth up
himself to take hold of Thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a>&nbsp; But such an
expression is the description of the outward effect, and not of
the inward movement of the soul, as is proved by that very text,
which gives us the reason <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>for the absence of any such stirring,
&ldquo;Thou hast hid Thy face from us.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
because He had hidden His face that no one was stirred to lay
hold on His grace.&nbsp; Thus St. Paul teaches us that it is God
Himself who worketh on the will.&nbsp; He urges the little flock
at Philippi to be more diligent in his absence than they were in
his presence, <a name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a> and in the next verse he gives us the
reason that &ldquo;It is God who worketh in you both to will and
to do of His good pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; So in this passage, when
Zerubbabel was aroused to a new action it was the Lord who
stirred his spirit, and who produced such a strong, deep feeling
in his soul that he could not rest without making a fresh effort
for the Lord.&nbsp; This stirring was the blessed result of the
Holy Spirit&rsquo;s action.&nbsp; Oh, that we had more of it
amongst ourselves!</p>
<p>But while it is the work of the Holy Spirit, we shall find
that, as a general rule, He makes use of means.&nbsp; Of course,
if He pleases, He may Himself speak to the soul in the way of
direct personal communication, and so arouse the heart and
conscience without the aid of any human instrumentality.&nbsp;
But in most cases He makes use of means.</p>
<p>Sometimes men are stirred by the sight of evil, as St. Paul
was stirred in spirit by the sight of the idolatry at Athens. <a
name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a>&nbsp; And it does seem strange that
God&rsquo;s faithful people can sit so still as they do, and look
on so quietly on the sin that abounds around them.&nbsp; How is
it that the whole soul does not burn within us with a longing
desire to be at work for God?</p>
<p>Sometimes it is through the power of the ministry.&nbsp; It
was so with Zerubbabel, of whom it is said that the Lord stirred
his spirit.&nbsp; The means employed in his case was the
preaching of the two prophets Haggai <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>and Zechariah.&nbsp; Sometimes God
raises up great preachers whose office it seems to be to awaken
nations.&nbsp; Such were Whitfield and the Wesleys.&nbsp; Such
was Luther at the time of the Reformation, and such were Haggai
and Zechariah after the return of the captives from
Babylon.&nbsp; It was through them that the fire was lighted in
the soul of Zerubbabel.&nbsp; Their burning words stirred his
spirit, and he threw himself with a holy zeal into the service of
the Lord.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is by the example and influence of others, as
&ldquo;iron sharpeneth iron.&rdquo; <a name="citation78a"></a><a
href="#footnote78a" class="citation">[78a]</a>&nbsp; There is
nothing more infectious than character.&nbsp; There is a certain
atmosphere surrounding each of us, and it has its influence on
all who come near us.&nbsp; The idle man makes others idle, the
corrupt man makes others corrupt; so the holy man wins others to
holiness, and the man of Christian enthusiasm will warm up those
who come in contact with him.</p>
<p>Sometimes He does it by stirring our nest.&nbsp; This is what
He did for Israel in Egypt.&nbsp; They had begun to settle down
content with their captivity.&nbsp; They had their flesh-pots,
their melons, and their cucumbers, and they did not care to be
unsettled; so God stirred them up by oppression.&nbsp; This is
the process described in Moses&rsquo; song, &ldquo;As an eagle
stirreth up her nest.&rdquo; <a name="citation78b"></a><a
href="#footnote78b" class="citation">[78b]</a>&nbsp; The young
eagles, being comfortable in their nest, have no desire to launch
forth into the untried experiment of flight.&nbsp; So the parent
bird stirs up the nest, and by means of that stirring compels
them to a move.&nbsp; Is it not often just the same with
us?&nbsp; We are so fond of our nests, so apt to settle down
quietly, forgetful of that which is to come.&nbsp; So God in
mercy stirs the nest.&nbsp; The heart is saddened, but the very
stirring may be God&rsquo;s appointed instrument for waking <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>up a new
hope, a new longing for the second advent, and a dependence never
known before on His own grace, and love, and perfect
sufficiency.</p>
<p>By whatever means the Lord does it, we must never forget that
it is His own divine act of mercy and grace.&nbsp; No sight of
evil, no preaching, no example, no chastening can produce the
result.&nbsp; It is God the Holy Ghost that stirs the spirit.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Consider the need of this stirring amongst the
faithful people of God.</p>
<p>It might be supposed that the true and faithful people of God
would not require it, and that they would be irresistibly drawn
on by the constraining power of the love of Christ.&nbsp; But
this is not the teaching of Scripture, and I am sure it is not
the conclusion from experience.&nbsp; We must never forget that
the wise virgins went to sleep.&nbsp; Nor must we even lose sight
of those thrilling words addressed by St. Paul to those in Rome
whom he describes as &ldquo;beloved of God, and called to be
saints,&rdquo; <a name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a> when in the prospect of the second
Advent he said to them, &ldquo;Now it is high time to awake out
of sleep.&rdquo; <a name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a>&nbsp; Had they not, you may say, been
already aroused from sleep?&nbsp; Had they not been awakened from
the sleep of death, and brought into a new life in Christ
Jesus?&nbsp; How, then, should it be high time for them to awake
out of sleep?&nbsp; Were they not already the &ldquo;beloved of
God&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Now, this brings us exactly to the point; to the great need of
Divine stirring, even for those who have already been awakened
into a new life in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Turn to the Song of
Solomon, and you will find the whole thing explained.&nbsp; In
ch. v. the Bridegroom is described as returning home at night,
and, knocking at the door of his home, calls to the Bride <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>within, and
says, &ldquo;Open to me.&rdquo; <a name="citation80"></a><a
href="#footnote80" class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; Now what is
her state of mind when she hears His knock and listens to His
voice? &ldquo;I sleep, but my heart waketh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have we
not there the exact description of very common Christian
life?&nbsp; How many are there still sleeping, though they hear
the knock and their heart waketh?&nbsp; They are neither fully
asleep nor fully awake.&nbsp; They are awake enough to hear the
voice, but too sleepy to act on it.&nbsp; But we cannot be
satisfied with this half and half condition.&nbsp; The Bride in
the Song of Solomon was so long in arousing herself, that when at
length she did so, it was too late.&nbsp; In ver. 6 she tells her
sad, sad story.&nbsp; &ldquo;I opened to my Beloved, but my
Beloved had withdrawn Himself and was gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Should
not such a description arouse us all?&nbsp; Most truly may it be
said that He is standing at our own doors both knocking and
calling.&nbsp; Sin is raging, error is spreading, misery is
abounding, hell is filling; but, thanks be to God, Christ Jesus
is saving, and shall His own chosen people be sleeping quietly,
seeking their own ease, and sitting down content if only they can
entertain a well-grounded hope that the heavy burden of their own
sin has been blotted out through His most precious blood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stir up, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the wills of Thy
faithful people.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>A
WILLING SERVICE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who then is willing to consecrate his
service this day unto the Lord?&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">Chron</span>. xxix. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> occasion was a very solemn
one.&nbsp; It was the last act of David&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; He
had long desired to build a temple for the glory of God, but he
was not allowed to carry out his wish.&nbsp; So he collected the
necessary materials, and at length, when he had decided to
abdicate in favour of Solomon, he called an assembly and declared
Solomon, who was still young and tender, to be his successor,
then handed over to him the plans which he had prepared for the
Temple, and concluded with a solemn charge. <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a></p>
<p>Having thus ended what may be termed the official business of
his life, the aged king proceeded to address the
congregation.&nbsp; Let us study four things in that address; his
question, his thanksgiving, his prayer, and his final appeal.</p>
<h3>HIS QUESTION</h3>
<p>He told them how he was passing away, and how the work was
great, so he asked them a question which may be well put to every
congregation in every age, &ldquo;Who then is willing to
consecrate his service this day unto the Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Now, we
hear a great deal in these days of consecration.&nbsp; The idea
of consecration is not a new thing in the Church of God, and I am
sure that we want more of the true spirit of it in our own
hearts.&nbsp; There is such a thing as consecration of heart, and
consecration of service.&nbsp; The consecration of heart is the
surrender of the whole man with the affections, the powers, and
the strong will to the Lord.&nbsp; The consecration of service is
the dedication of all our active powers to his work.&nbsp; When
David said, &ldquo;I am thine,&rdquo; <a
name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a> it was the consecration of heart, and
when Isaiah said, &ldquo;Here am I, send me,&rdquo; <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> it was the consecration of
service.&nbsp; Now, it was the consecration of service for which
David appealed, and it is this practical consecration of service
on which we are dependent for the work in a parish.&nbsp; Who is
willing to consecrate his service?&nbsp; I cannot see into the
secrets of the hearts, but I know who ought to be
willing&mdash;all those who believe in the words of our Blessed
Saviour, &ldquo;For their sakes I consecrate Myself.&rdquo; <a
name="citation82c"></a><a href="#footnote82c"
class="citation">[82c]</a>&nbsp; Did He, the spotless Son of God,
consecrate Himself to be the atoning sacrifice for us?&nbsp; And
if we believe that, can we doubt for one moment who it is that
should be willing to consecrate his service to Him?&nbsp;
Redeemed sinner, is it not you?&nbsp; Pardoned believer, is it
not you?&nbsp; Are you ready to fall at His feet and say,
&ldquo;Here am I; let me be Thine.&nbsp; Here is my skill: use
it.&nbsp; Here is my intellect: use it.&nbsp; Here is my power of
speech: use it.&nbsp; Here is my money: use it.&nbsp; Here is
all, all I have and all I am: let it all be Thine own, and help
me to employ it for Thy glory&rdquo;?</p>
<h3><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>HIS
PRAISE</h3>
<p>David&rsquo;s question fell on willing hearts, and there was a
wonderful response to his appeal.&nbsp; Gold, silver, and
precious stones were poured into the treasury, and the willing
heart with which all was done was beautiful.&nbsp; It was not
done grudgingly or of necessity, but with a happy, joyous,
thankful spirit, so that the old man&rsquo;s heart was gladdened,
and &ldquo;David the King rejoiced with great joy.&rdquo; <a
name="citation83a"></a><a href="#footnote83a"
class="citation">[83a]</a>&nbsp; It was this joyous spirit that
called forth his praise.&nbsp; When he saw the blessed result of
his appeal he did not lay it down to his personal influence, or
to his own persuasive power, but he stood up and blessed the
Lord.&nbsp; He was too old for government, but he was not too old
for praise.&nbsp; His last words from the throne were those of
praise and prayer.&nbsp; His joy ran straight into thanksgiving,
and in this thanksgiving two principles were conspicuous, he gave
all the glory to God, and he acknowledged himself and his people
to be utterly unworthy of the sacred privilege of this happy
service.&nbsp; This is the true view of service and of
gifts.&nbsp; When God calls us to work for Him, or to give for
Him, we should not regard it as a burden laid upon us, but as an
honour to which we are invited, an honour that angels themselves
might covet.&nbsp; This was the spirit of David when he said
&ldquo;What am I, and what is my people, that we should be able
to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.&rdquo; <a
name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b"
class="citation">[83b]</a>&nbsp; And this should be our own
spirit in all service and all gifts for such a Lord.&nbsp; We do
not want to regard it as a yoke, a necessity, a heavy task
imposed on us by God; but <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>as an honour, a privilege, a happy,
loving service of the King of kings, for which the best amongst
us is utterly unworthy.</p>
<h3>HIS PRAYER</h3>
<p>After a time his praise ran into prayer.&nbsp; This is just as
it ought to be, for praise should encourage prayer, as prayer
should always lead to praise.&nbsp; Thus the loving heart should
pass backwards and forwards from one to the other, and the two
should be so blended that when we are engaged by the one the
other should never be out of sight.</p>
<p>Observe the prayer in ver. 18, and remember the
circumstances.&nbsp; It was a moment of wonderful national
enthusiasm at the commencement of a great national work.&nbsp;
Their hearts were filled with joy and they were ready for
anything.&nbsp; Now, what was the danger?&nbsp; What would be the
danger to ourselves in our own day?&nbsp; Would it not be decay,
a gradual dying off of our first zeal, a chill in the first love
as there was at Ephesus? <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; What David
prayed for, therefore, was continuance, or perseverance.&nbsp; In
short he prayed against declension from their first love, for
look at his words in ver. 18.&nbsp; For &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; the
marginal reading is &ldquo;stablish.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now you see
the point of the prayer, &ldquo;Keep this <i>for ever</i> in the
imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and
<i>establish</i> their heart unto Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; What an
insight it gives both as to our danger and our hope.&nbsp; How it
shows us our need of being kept alive in our first love, and
teaches us that we must not be trusting to the privileges of past
experience, or the fact of past consecration, but that we need
the perpetual action of the Holy Spirit <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>in keeping
His grace for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the
heart.</p>
<p>And where are we to look for this preservation?&nbsp; Do we
not learn that our hearts are like leaky vessels, and the
brightest, holiest and most joyous of believers requires the
daily power of the Holy Spirit, not merely to stop the leak, but
to fill the vessel?</p>
<h3>THE FINAL APPEAL</h3>
<p>The old man finished his prayer.&nbsp; In it he spoke
alone.&nbsp; He was, as it were, the mouthpiece of his
people.&nbsp; But that was not enough.&nbsp; It was not
sufficient that he should speak on their behalf, but they must
praise God for themselves.&nbsp; So having been into the very
presence chamber of God in prayer, he came out, as it were to the
assembled multitude, and said to the vast throng, &ldquo;Now
bless the Lord your God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Praise was the climax of
the transaction, and praise the last act of David&rsquo;s
reign.</p>
<p>Now may there be the spirit of that remarkable day amongst
ourselves.&nbsp; Trace it all the way through, remember the
consecration, the liberality, the joy, the praise, the prayer,
and the final outburst of congregational worship.&nbsp; May God
breathe on us the same spirit.&nbsp; May there be the same
consecration of service, the same willing offerings, the same
joyous praise, and the same thankful prayer for a holy
perseverance unto the end.&nbsp; And, in conclusion, may I not
say to you what David said to the congregation, &ldquo;Now bless
the Lord your God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>FEAR
NOT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not
dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will
help thee: yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
righteousness.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isa</span>. xli.
10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we observe how frequently God
says to us &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; we may be quite sure that
there is a great deal in common life to occasion fear.&nbsp; The
frequent recurrence of the exhortation in all parts of Scripture
teaches us, that through the whole range of Scriptural history
there had been that all around God&rsquo;s people which, without
the Lord&rsquo;s help, must have been sure to make the heart
afraid.</p>
<p>You will observe in our text that He does not bid us fear not
because He undertakes to remove all danger.&nbsp; What He says
is, that when things arise that may justly alarm us, we need not
fear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear not, <i>for</i> I am with thee,&rdquo;
(observe the &ldquo;<i>for</i>&rdquo;).&nbsp; If fear is to be
really overcome, it must be by the eye being kept fixed on God
and His promises.</p>
<p>This verse contains two assurances and three promises;
assurances of what He is to us now, and promises of what He
undertakes to do for us.</p>
<h3>THE ASSURANCES</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I am with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am thy
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is interesting to observe how the different
portions of Scripture <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>correspond with one another.&nbsp;
They are all inspired by one Spirit, and all speak one
truth.&nbsp; So when I turn to the concluding description of the
blessedness of the Heavenly inheritance, I find just the same
assurance, &ldquo;God Himself shall be with them and be their
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a>&nbsp; He does not promise to be nearer
to His people, even in the heavenly rest, than He declares
Himself to be now, when we are in the midst of our struggle upon
earth.&nbsp; He promises <i>then</i> to be with us and to be our
God, and He assures us in the text that He is just the same
<i>now</i>.</p>
<p>The words of the assurance, &ldquo;I am with thee,&rdquo;
imply both reconciliation and companionship.&nbsp;
Reconciliation, for He is not against us, but with us.&nbsp; Not
separated by the barrier of unforgiven sin, but so completely
reconciled, the law being satisfied that every barrier is broken
down for ever, and He is altogether on our side.</p>
<p>Companionship, for as a reconciled and loving Father He never
for a moment leaves His child, by night or by day, in joy or in
sorrow; in active work, or in quiet submission; in the ministry
at home or in the distant work of missions.&nbsp; Wherever His
people are, and in whatever circumstances, there is He with them
as their Father, their Friend, their Companion, their Helper,
their God.</p>
<p>For He also says, &ldquo;I am thy God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is not
merely with us, but with us in all the omnipotence of
Godhead.&nbsp; An earthly friend may fail in helping us; but when
He is with us as our God He will never fail.&nbsp; When He says,
&ldquo;I am thy God,&rdquo; He clearly means that He has chosen
us to be His people, a peculiar people unto Himself; and that,
having done so, He acts as God, on our behalf, governing,
guiding, <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>preserving, saving, and finally gathering to His own
presence in His kingdom.</p>
<h3>THE PROMISES</h3>
<p>(1)&nbsp; &ldquo;I will strengthen thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into whatever position He places us, for that He undertakes to
give us the needful strength.&nbsp; If He calls us to be still
and suffer, He will give strength for suffering; if to go forth
in His name and labour in His service, He will give strength for
activity; and in the holy warfare which we are all called to wage
with indwelling sin, strength to overcome.&nbsp; And you must
notice that, when He promises to strengthen, He describes an
imparted power.&nbsp; He does not speak of Himself as acting for
you externally, as when He accounts you righteous; but within
you, imparting power, and so enabling you to act for Him.&nbsp;
The promise of God in Scripture is that He will strengthen us,
or, in other words, that He will impart a power of action in His
service.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; &ldquo;I will help thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same lesson respecting man&rsquo;s activity is taught when
He promises to help.&nbsp; There is a great difference between
strengthening and helping.&nbsp; To strengthen is an inward work,
the gift of an inward power.&nbsp; To help is an external
work.&nbsp; I may help a lame man to walk, though I cannot
strengthen his limb.&nbsp; But help implies activity on the part
of those who receive it.&nbsp; God does not help us to do
nothing.&nbsp; He helps us to be patient, loving, gentle,
sweet-tempered.&nbsp; He helps us to be diligent and active in
His service; but He does not help us to sit still and be
passive.&nbsp; Help implies exertion.&nbsp; If He strengthens us
by the Holy <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Ghost in the inner man, and if He undertakes to help us
in every struggle against sin, it is our privilege to accept His
promise, and press on, assured of victory.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; &ldquo;I will uphold thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words appear to convey the idea of danger.&nbsp; We are
walking in slippery places, and with fearful falls on every hand,
so that we require not merely a clear eye to guide us, but a
strong hand to hold us.&nbsp; In every step of our way we require
to be upheld.&nbsp; In every moment of our lives we require to be
held up by one who sees all our danger, who knows the path
perfectly well, who can hold us with so strong a grasp that
nothing can pluck us out of His hand, and who, according to the
language of St. Jude, is &ldquo;able to keep us from
falling.&rdquo; <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a></p>
<p>It is this perpetual and final preservation that is secured to
us in the third promise; and I would have you most particularly
observe that it is not with the right hand of His mercy, or the
right hand of His love, or of His compassion, or even of His
power, but the right hand of His righteousness.&nbsp; And why is
this?&nbsp; Because this grace is the result of the
covenant.&nbsp; By that covenant His people are given to the Lord
Jesus that they may be saved.&nbsp; In fulfilling that covenant
He has shed His own most precious blood for us, to make atonement
for our sin.&nbsp; And the result is, that as, according to St.
John, &ldquo;He is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins,&rdquo; <a name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a> so, also, is He faithful and just to
uphold us against a fall.</p>
<p>But here, I know, a question will arise.&nbsp; This is
God&rsquo;s promise, but is it ever realized?&nbsp; It is very
beautiful in Scripture, but do we meet with it in practical
life?&nbsp; Are these gifts of God really given?&nbsp; Is this
presence of God really displayed? this <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>upholding power really
experienced?&nbsp; Let us consider these five points and see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Has this been practically
experienced?&nbsp; Look at the words of David in the prospect of
his dying hour, &ldquo;Thou art with me,&rdquo; <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> and, again, &ldquo;O God, Thou art my
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b"
class="citation">[90b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will strengthen thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember how
Daniel realized its fulfilment when he said, &ldquo;Let my Lord
speak; for Thou hast strengthened me.&rdquo; <a
name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will help thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember David&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped.&rdquo; <a
name="citation90d"></a><a href="#footnote90d"
class="citation">[90d]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will uphold thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; But will He really
uphold us through trials and temptations?&nbsp; Will He really
keep us fast in the right hand of His righteousness, and that
when our faith is weak?&nbsp; Turn to Asaph&rsquo;s
experience.&nbsp; He says of himself, &ldquo;As for me, my feet
were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipped.&rdquo; <a
name="citation90e"></a><a href="#footnote90e"
class="citation">[90e]</a>&nbsp; But now look at the upholding
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou
hast holden me by my right hand.&rdquo; <a
name="citation90f"></a><a href="#footnote90f"
class="citation">[90f]</a>&nbsp; So, then, this promise has been
practically fulfilled.&nbsp; God has been true to His word, and
men have found Him so.&nbsp; His truth has never failed, and will
He fail us?&nbsp; Will he fail the weakest amongst us?&nbsp; Will
He cease to uphold His people?&nbsp; Let us trust Him.&nbsp; We
are not worthy to do so.&nbsp; If He had treated us as we have
deserved, He would long since have cast us off.&nbsp; But He has
not treated us as we have deserved.&nbsp; He has loved us and
washed us from our sins in His own blood, so we may trust Him,
and leave all in His care; and of this we may rest perfectly
assured, that the strong arm will never give way.</p>
<h2><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>THE
PRESENT AND THE FUTURE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup
runneth over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psa</span>. xxiii. 5,
6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very delightful thing to be
able to say &ldquo;Surely&rdquo; when we look forward.&nbsp; Now,
this sureness for the future depends on our present relationship
to God, and the confidence expressed in verse 6 is the blessed
result of the unspeakably precious gifts described in the earlier
verses of the Psalm.&nbsp; It depends on the connection between
the present and the future, a connection resulting from the
unchangeableness in the character of God.&nbsp; In order,
therefore, to understand the last verse which relates to the
future, let us study the one preceding it, which describes the
present.&nbsp; We may thus combine the present and the future,
and I think the result will be what our Church describes as a
&ldquo;sure and certain hope.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE PRESENT</h3>
<p>As I have just said, our confidence for the future depends on
our present relationship to God; and, accordingly, the Psalm
opens with the words, &ldquo;The <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Lord is my Shepherd.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
holy relationship between the Shepherd and the flock is described
as being already established, and by both parties recognized, and
all that follows is the result of that relationship.&nbsp; We
have not time to study the whole Psalm; but look at the three
results taught us in verse 5.</p>
<h4>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">All Wants are
Supplied</span>.</h4>
<p>Even if there are enemies, they cannot interfere with the full
and sure supply which God has provided for His servant.&nbsp;
When he reaches the end of his journey, he will find that the
Lord has prepared a place for his rest; and now that he is in the
midst of it, he may rejoice in that the same most blessed Saviour
has prepared a table for his daily supply.</p>
<p>This refers, doubtless, to our daily wants, and it describes
His fulfilment of our supplication in the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer.&nbsp; We pray day by day, &ldquo;Give us this day our
daily bread;&rdquo; and when we really enter into the spirit of
this Psalm, we as much as say that the prayer is answered, the
bread provided, and the table spread.</p>
<p>And may we not apply it still more to the bread of life?&nbsp;
Is it not our sacred privilege, when the soul is hungered, to
feed even on Him; when the soul is athirst, to drink of the pure
river of the water of life?&nbsp; And are there not many amongst
us who know, by their own experience, the truth of the promise,
&ldquo;They shall be abundantly satisfied?&rdquo; <a
name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a></p>
<h4>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Spirit is
Refreshed</span>.</h4>
<p>This is taught in the words, &ldquo;Thou anointest my head
with oil.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words refer to the custom of anointing
the weary man with ointment or oil.&nbsp; It was poured sometimes
on the feet and sometimes on the head.&nbsp; The object in both
cases was the same, <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>namely, refreshment; and surely we must thankfully
acknowledge that our Heavenly Father does not merely give us the
bare necessities of existence, but softens, refreshes, and cheers
the spirit.&nbsp; He prepares not the table only, but the
joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;He giveth us richly all things to enjoy.&rdquo;
<a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a></p>
<h4>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Cup Overflows</span>.</h4>
<p>The mercies are so rich, the grace so abundant, the
loving-kindness so bountiful, the living fountain so free, that
the little cup of human capacity cannot hold it all, and it
runneth over.&nbsp; God describes His people as not merely
satisfied, but abundantly satisfied; and speaks of the Holy
Spirit as not merely bestowed, but as &ldquo;shed on us
abundantly.&rdquo; <a name="citation93b"></a><a
href="#footnote93b" class="citation">[93b]</a>&nbsp; Why, then,
are we content with a little water hardly perceptible at the
bottom of our little cup?&nbsp; Stephen was &ldquo;full of faith
and of the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; <a name="citation93c"></a><a
href="#footnote93c" class="citation">[93c]</a> and we are told to
be &ldquo;filled with the Spirit;&rdquo; <a
name="citation93d"></a><a href="#footnote93d"
class="citation">[93d]</a> why, then, rest content with only a
few drops in our own soul while there is the deep, broad river of
the water of life able to fill, to overflowing, every vessel that
can be found to receive the free supply?&nbsp; Why do we not
realize more the truth of the promise, &ldquo;Open thy mouth
wide, and I will fill it&rdquo;? <a name="citation93e"></a><a
href="#footnote93e" class="citation">[93e]</a></p>
<p>So much, then, for the present.&nbsp; A table prepared, a head
anointed, a cup running over.&nbsp; These are present
gifts&mdash;the present and indescribable privileges of those
whose joy it is to be able to say, &ldquo;The Lord is my
Shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>THE
FUTURE</h3>
<p>Let us pass on to the future as taught in verse 6.&nbsp; We
may observe two things&mdash;</p>
<h4>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Assurance</span>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea seems to be that, in the poetry
of this beautiful Psalm, Goodness and Mercy are represented as
two persons, just as we find first Mercy and Truth as two persons
meeting each other in Christ Jesus, and then Righteousness and
Peace, two other persons, kissing each other in Him. <a
name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a>&nbsp; So here we have the two persons:
Goodness, the bearer of every gift that can possibly be required,
and Mercy dealing most graciously even with sin; the two
following the servant of the Lord, and never leaving him all the
way through.&nbsp; And you may observe they <i>follow</i> him, so
that he does not always see them, and may not even know they are
there.&nbsp; He may sometimes imagine that he is forsaken and
alone, but he is strangely mistaken, for Goodness and Mercy are
close behind, the one to supply his need, and the other to deal
graciously even with his sin.</p>
<p>If we are in Christ Jesus, we may be as sure of the future as
of the past.&nbsp; We may be perfectly certain of the truth of
the words of the Good Shepherd, &ldquo;They shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.&rdquo; <a
name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a>&nbsp; That promise is so sure that it
can never fail, that hand so strong that all the powers of hell
cannot pluck the weakest little one from its grasp, that heart so
true that we may be perfectly certain He will never abandon one
whom He has called by the Holy Ghost into fellowship with
Himself.</p>

Determination</span>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; David delighted in the house of God; and
clearly we must explain these words as referring to the holy
worship of the sanctuary.&nbsp; But in order to enter into the
full spirit of the passage, we must rise from the Church on earth
to the sanctuary in heaven; to the heavenly home and the presence
chamber of God.&nbsp; There, indeed, is the table spread, there
is the anointing oil, there the cup runneth over; and now,
through the rest of our pilgrimage, though the journey may
possibly be through the Vale of Baca, <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a> though sometimes the soul may be bowed
down, and that even when the heart is fixed, yet in the midst of
it all, and through it all, we may live in a close intimacy with
Him.&nbsp; We may quietly rest in His love, we may dwell in Him
and He in us; and while He gives the gracious promise, &ldquo;Him
that cometh to Me I will in no wise <i>cast</i> out,&rdquo; <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a> we may resolve, God helping us, that
we will never <i>go</i> out, and that, to the last day of our
lives, we will hold fast by Him, till at length the veil shall be
withdrawn, and the heavenly home open before us, and we realize
what it is, in the highest possible sense, &ldquo;to dwell in the
house of the Lord for ever.&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
